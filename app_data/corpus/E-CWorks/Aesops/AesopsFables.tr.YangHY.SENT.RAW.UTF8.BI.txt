<seg id="3">THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</seg>
<seg id="3">狐狸和葡萄</seg>
<seg id="4">A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air.</seg>
<seg id="4">饥肠辘辘的狐狸看到一串串诱人的葡萄沿着高高的树藤挂落下来，它用力往空中一跃，伸手去摘葡萄。</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, "I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour."</seg>
<seg id="5">但这完全是徒劳的，因为葡萄刚好在够不到的地方，所以狐狸只好放弃了。离开时，它悻悻然地说：“我想，那些葡萄虽然已经熟了，但现在看起来还很酸呢。”</seg>
<seg id="6">THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS</seg>
<seg id="6">下金蛋的鹅</seg>
<seg id="7">A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">一对夫妇幸运地拥有一只每天会下金蛋的鹅。</seg>
<seg id="8">Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once.</seg>
<seg id="8">尽管他们是那么幸运，但不久，他们开始认为这样致富不够快，猜想禽类的体内肯定有金块。于是，他们决定，把鹅宰了能立刻得到昂贵的金块。</seg>
<seg id="9">But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose.</seg>
<seg id="9">但是，当他们把鹅开膛破肚后，发现这只鹅只不过是像任何其他鹅一样。</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.</seg>
<seg id="10">因此，他们既没有像希望的那样一夜暴富，也再享受不到日进斗金了。</seg>
<seg id="11">Much wants more and loses all.</seg>
<seg id="11">贪婪会导致失去一切。</seg>
<seg id="12">THE CAT AND THE MICE</seg>
<seg id="12">猫和老鼠</seg>
<seg id="13">There was once a house that was overrun with Mice.</seg>
<seg id="13">有一幢房子曾经有老鼠出没。</seg>
<seg id="14">A Cat heard of this, and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one and ate them.</seg>
<seg id="14">一只猫得知此事后，自言自语道：“那正是适合我的地方。”于是，它来到房子门口站岗，把老鼠一只只抓来吃了。</seg>
<seg id="15">At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there.</seg>
<seg id="15">终于，老鼠再也不能在那里待下去了，它们决定回自己的洞里待着。</seg>
<seg id="16">"That's awkward," said the Cat to herself: "the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick."</seg>
<seg id="16">“那是有点棘手的，”猫自言自语，“唯一能做的就是使个把戏把它们骗出来。”</seg>
<seg id="17">So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead.</seg>
<seg id="17">它细细琢磨了一下，然后爬上墙，把后腿挂在一个钩子上，让自己挂下来装死。</seg>
<seg id="18">By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there.</seg>
<seg id="18">不久，一只老鼠从隐蔽处出现，看到猫悬挂在那儿。</seg>
<seg id="19">"Aha!" it cried, "you're very clever, madam, no doubt:</seg>
<seg id="19">“啊哈！”它大喊道，“女士，我想你太聪明了，这毫无疑问，</seg>
<seg id="20">but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you."</seg>
<seg id="20">但是，即使你把自己变成一只食品袋悬挂在那儿，也休想让我们靠近你半步，免得你抓住我们。”</seg>
<seg id="21">If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs of those whom you have once found to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="21">如果你聪明的话，就不会被敌人伪装的假象所蒙骗。</seg>
<seg id="22">THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG</seg>
<seg id="22">淘气的狗</seg>
<seg id="23">There was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to his master's house.</seg>
<seg id="23">曾经有一条狗常常扑到人们的身上，无缘无故就张口咬人。对于来主人家拜访的每一个人来说，它是一个非常讨厌的家伙。</seg>
<seg id="24">So his master fastened a bell round his neck to warn people of his presence.</seg>
<seg id="24">因此，主人就系了一只铃铛绕在它的脖子上，提醒人们注意它的行踪。</seg>
<seg id="25">The Dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="25">狗因这个铃铛而洋洋得意，并且炫耀地发出叮当声，从中得到了极大的满足。</seg>
<seg id="26">But an old dog came up to him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend.</seg>
<seg id="26">然而，有一条老狗走过来对它说：“朋友，低调一点会更好。</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit?</seg>
<seg id="27">你没有想过吧，铃铛难道是给予你所做功劳的奖赏？</seg>
<seg id="28">On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace."</seg>
<seg id="28">恰恰相反，那是耻辱的标志。”</seg>
<seg id="29">Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.</seg>
<seg id="29">声名狼藉常常被误认为大名鼎鼎。</seg>
<seg id="30">THE CHARCOAL-BURNER AND THE FULLER</seg>
<seg id="30">烧炭工和漂洗工</seg>
<seg id="31">There was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself.</seg>
<seg id="31">从前有位烧炭工，独自一人生活和工作。</seg>
<seg id="32">A Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same neighbourhood;</seg>
<seg id="32">后来，一位漂洗工恰好也来到这个地区定居。</seg>
<seg id="33">and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would come and share his house:</seg>
<seg id="33">烧炭工认识他以后，发现他是一个值得交往的人，就问他是否愿意搬来一起住。</seg>
<seg id="34">"We shall get to know one another better that way," he said, "and, beside, our household expenses will be diminished."</seg>
<seg id="34">烧炭工说：“那样的话，我们将更好地相互了解，而且我们的家用开支将会减少。”</seg>
<seg id="35">The Fuller thanked him, but replied, "I couldn't think of it, sir:</seg>
<seg id="35">漂洗工谢过了他的好意，回答说：“先生，我不能和你同住，</seg>
<seg id="36">why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be blackened in no time by your charcoal."</seg>
<seg id="36">为什么呢，因为我费力漂白的每一件东西也许立即会被你的木炭熏黑。”</seg>
<seg id="37">THE MICE IN COUNCIL</seg>
<seg id="37">老鼠开会</seg>
<seg id="38">Once upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat.</seg>
<seg id="38">很久以前，老鼠们聚在一起开会，要讨论出一个最好的办法来抵抗猫的袭击。</seg>
<seg id="39">After several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing and experience got up and said, "I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it out.</seg>
<seg id="39">几条建议讨论下来，有一只老鼠站起来说：“我突然想到一个计划，可以确保我们今后的安全，如果你们同意的话就可以执行。</seg>
<seg id="40">It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach."</seg>
<seg id="40">我们应该在我们的敌人——猫的脖子上系一个铃铛，当它靠近时，铃铛发出的叮当声会提醒我们。”</seg>
<seg id="41">This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to adopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, "I agree with you all that the plan before us is an admirable one:</seg>
<seg id="41">这条建议得到了老鼠们的热烈赞许，并且已经决定采纳。此时，一只上了年纪的老鼠站出来说：“我同意，你的这个计划是我们所有计划中最棒的一个，</seg>
<seg id="42">but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?"</seg>
<seg id="42">但我想问，谁去给猫系铃铛呢？”</seg>
<seg id="43">THE BAT AND THE WEASELS</seg>
<seg id="43">蝙蝠和黄鼠狼</seg>
<seg id="44">A Bat fell to the ground and was caught by a Weasel, and was just going to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go.</seg>
<seg id="44">一只蝙蝠跌落在地上，被黄鼠狼逮住了，当它就要被吃掉时，它请求黄鼠狼放过自己。</seg>
<seg id="45">The Weasel said he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on principle.</seg>
<seg id="45">黄鼠狼说它不能这么做，因为从原则上讲，蝙蝠是所有鸟类的天敌。</seg>
<seg id="46">"Oh, but," said the Bat, "I'm not a bird at all: I'm a mouse."</seg>
<seg id="46">“噢，但是，”蝙蝠说，“我根本不是鸟，我是鼠。”</seg>
<seg id="47">"So you are," said the Weasel, "now I come to look at you"; and he let it go.</seg>
<seg id="47">“那么你是鼠，”黄鼠狼说，“我就接受你的说法吧。”然后，黄鼠狼就放了蝙蝠。</seg>
<seg id="48">Some time after this the Bat was caught in just the same way by another Weasel, and, as before, begged for its life.</seg>
<seg id="48">一段时间以后，蝙蝠同样被另一只黄鼠狼逮住了，和之前一样，蝙蝠请求黄鼠狼饶了它的命。</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," said the Weasel, "I never let a mouse go by any chance."</seg>
<seg id="49">“不行，”黄鼠狼说，“我从来不会让鼠类有任何机会走。”</seg>
<seg id="50">"But I'm not a mouse," said the Bat; "I'm a bird."</seg>
<seg id="50">“但我不是鼠，”蝙蝠说，“我是鸟。”</seg>
<seg id="51">"Why, so you are," said the Weasel; and he too let the Bat go.</seg>
<seg id="51">“原来你是鸟啊。”黄鼠狼说道，接着也放走了蝙蝠。</seg>
<seg id="52">Look and see which way the wind blows before you commit yourself.</seg>
<seg id="52">认清形势，随机应变。</seg>
<seg id="53">THE DOG AND THE SOW</seg>
<seg id="53">狗和猪</seg>
<seg id="54">A Dog and a Sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones were finer than those of any other animal.</seg>
<seg id="54">一条狗和一头猪在争论，各自声称自己的孩子比其他任何动物更出色。</seg>
<seg id="55">"Well," said the Sow at last, "mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world:</seg>
<seg id="55">争到最后，猪说：“至少我的孩子一出生时就能看见东西，</seg>
<seg id="56">but yours are born blind."</seg>
<seg id="56">而你的孩子出生时还没有视力呢。”</seg>
<seg id="57">THE FOX AND THE CROW</seg>
<seg id="57">狐狸和乌鸦</seg>
<seg id="58">A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="58">狐狸发现，有一只乌鸦嘴里衔着一片奶酪停在树枝上，它就想方设法要得到那片奶酪。</seg>
<seg id="59">Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me!</seg>
<seg id="59">狐狸走到那棵树下，仰起头对乌鸦说：“我看见上面有一只多么尊贵的鸟啊！</seg>
<seg id="60">Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite.</seg>
<seg id="60">它的美丽无与伦比，它的羽毛色泽光鲜。</seg>
<seg id="61">If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."</seg>
<seg id="61">要是它的嗓音像它的长相一样甜美就好了，那它毫无疑问就是鸟中之王。”</seg>
<seg id="62">The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw.</seg>
<seg id="62">乌鸦听了这些奉承的话非常受用，呱呱大叫要立即表现给狐狸看。</seg>
<seg id="63">Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."</seg>
<seg id="63">奶酪自然从乌鸦嘴里掉了下来，狐狸趁机接住，并说：“夫人，你有歌喉，但我觉得，你所需要的是智慧。”</seg>
<seg id="64">THE HORSE AND THE GROOM</seg>
<seg id="64">马和马夫</seg>
<seg id="65">There was once a Groom who used to spend long hours clipping and combing the Horse of which he had charge, but who daily stole a portion of his allowance of oats, and sold it for his own profit.</seg>
<seg id="65">从前，有一个马夫常常要花很多时间为他饲养的马修剪梳理毛发。但是，他却每天偷一点马的饲料——燕麦来补贴开销，把燕麦卖了作为自己的收益。</seg>
<seg id="66">The Horse gradually got into worse and worse condition, and at last cried to the Groom, "If you really want me to look sleek and well, you must comb me less and feed me more."</seg>
<seg id="66">马的健康状况逐渐越来越差。最后，它哭着对马夫说：“如果你真正想让我看起来光鲜亮丽，你可以为我梳理得少一点，喂养得多一点。”</seg>
<seg id="67">THE WOLF AND THE LAMB</seg>
<seg id="67">狼和小羊</seg>
<seg id="68">A Wolf came upon a Lamb straying from the flock, and felt some compunction about taking the life of so helpless a creature without some plausible excuse;</seg>
<seg id="68">狼偶然遇到一只掉队的小羊，它觉得要夺走如此弱小动物的性命，没有花言巧语的借口会有些内疚，</seg>
<seg id="69">so he cast about for a grievance and said at last, "Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me."</seg>
<seg id="69">因此，狼满腹牢骚地开口对小羊说：“小子，你去年粗暴地骂过我。”</seg>
<seg id="70">"That is impossible, sir," bleated the Lamb, "for I wasn't born then."</seg>
<seg id="70">“先生，这是不可能的，”小羊轻声细语地说，“那时我还没出生呢。”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Well," retorted the Wolf, "you feed in my pastures."</seg>
<seg id="71">狼驳斥道：“你吃了我的牧草。”</seg>
<seg id="72">"That cannot be," replied the Lamb, "for I have never yet tasted grass."</seg>
<seg id="72">“那也不可能，”小羊回答，“因为我从未尝过牧草的滋味。”</seg>
<seg id="73">"You drink from my spring, then," continued the Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="73">“那么，你在我的泉里喝过水。”狼继续说。</seg>
<seg id="74">"Indeed, sir," said the poor Lamb, "I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk."</seg>
<seg id="74">“说实在的，先生，”可怜的小羊说，“除了妈妈的乳汁，我还从未喝过任何东西。”</seg>
<seg id="75">"Well, anyhow," said the Wolf, "I'm not going without my dinner":</seg>
<seg id="75">“不管怎样，”狼说，“我不能没有晚餐。”</seg>
<seg id="76">and he sprang upon the Lamb and devoured it without more ado.</seg>
<seg id="76">于是，它扑向小羊，没费多大力气就狼吞虎咽地把小羊吃了。</seg>
<seg id="77">THE PEACOCK AND THE CRANE</seg>
<seg id="77">孔雀和鹤</seg>
<seg id="78">A Peacock taunted a Crane with the dullness of her plumage.</seg>
<seg id="78">孔雀嘲笑鹤的羽毛黯淡无色。</seg>
<seg id="79">"Look at my brilliant colours," said she, "and see how much finer they are than your poor feathers."</seg>
<seg id="79">“瞧我这一身绚丽的色彩，”孔雀说，“比你那毫无光泽的羽毛看上去漂亮多了。”</seg>
<seg id="80">"I am not denying," replied the Crane, "that yours are far gayer than mine;</seg>
<seg id="80">“我不否认，”鹤回答，“你的羽毛是比我的更亮丽，</seg>
<seg id="81">but when it comes to flying I can soar into the clouds, whereas you are confined to the earth like any dunghill cock."</seg>
<seg id="81">但说到飞行，我能直冲云霄，而你受限于地面，像任何一只粪堆上的公鸡一样。”</seg>
<seg id="82">THE CAT AND THE BIRDS</seg>
<seg id="82">猫和鸟</seg>
<seg id="83">A Cat heard that the Birds in an aviary were ailing.</seg>
<seg id="83">猫听说鸟舍里的鸟生病了。</seg>
<seg id="84">So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the Birds.</seg>
<seg id="84">于是，它把自己打扮成医生，并且带了一套医用器具，出现在鸟舍门口，询问鸟的健康状况。</seg>
<seg id="85">"We shall do very well," they replied, without letting him in, "when we've seen the last of you."</seg>
<seg id="85">“要是我们再也看不到你，我们会过得很好。”鸟儿们回答道，没有让猫进去。</seg>
<seg id="86">A villain may disguise himself, but he will not deceive the wise.</seg>
<seg id="86">坏人也许能伪装自己，但他永远骗不了智者。</seg>
<seg id="87">THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE SWALLOW</seg>
<seg id="87">败家子和燕子</seg>
<seg id="88">A Spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early spring.</seg>
<seg id="88">有一个败家子，挥霍完了他的财产，除了身上的一套大衣外什么也没有了。有一天，春光明媚，他看见一只燕子，</seg>
<seg id="89">Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch.</seg>
<seg id="89">以为夏天已经来了，现在不需要大衣了，于是就把大衣卖了个好价钱。</seg>
<seg id="90">A change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp frost which killed the unfortunate Swallow.</seg>
<seg id="90">然而，天气发生了变化，凛冽的严寒天气来临，不幸的燕子被冻死了。</seg>
<seg id="91">When the Spendthrift saw its dead body he cried, "Miserable bird!</seg>
<seg id="91">败家子看见燕子的尸体，痛哭道：“可怜的鸟儿啊！</seg>
<seg id="92">Thanks to you I am perishing of cold myself."</seg>
<seg id="92">因为你，我自己也要被冻死了。”</seg>
<seg id="93">One swallow does not make summer.</seg>
<seg id="93">燕不知夏。</seg>
<seg id="94">THE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="94">老妇人和医生</seg>
<seg id="95">An Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing.</seg>
<seg id="95">一位老妇人因患有眼疾几乎看不见了，她咨询了一位医生后，当着证人的面和医生达成协议，如果能治好她的眼睛，她就付给医生一笔高额酬金；如果治不好，医生什么都得不到。</seg>
<seg id="96">The Doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, and every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, until at last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was complete, there was nothing left.</seg>
<seg id="96">医生按照规定进行一个疗程的治疗，他每次去老妇人那儿都乘机拿走屋子里的一些物品。终于，当他最后一次去老妇人那儿的时候，老妇人的眼睛完全治愈了，但家里什么也没有了。</seg>
<seg id="97">When the Old Woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee;</seg>
<seg id="97">当老妇人看见屋子里空空荡荡时，她拒绝支付医生的酬金。</seg>
<seg id="98">and, after repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt.</seg>
<seg id="98">遭到老妇人的一再拒绝后，医生在法官面前起诉老妇人欠了他的报酬。</seg>
<seg id="99">On being brought into court she was ready with her defence.</seg>
<seg id="99">法庭上，老妇人胸有成竹地为自己辩护。</seg>
<seg id="100">"The claimant," said she, "has stated the facts about our agreement correctly.</seg>
<seg id="100">她说：“原告正确履行了我们约定的事项。</seg>
<seg id="101">I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed.</seg>
<seg id="101">如果他治好了我的眼睛，我保证付给他一笔酬金；如果他治不好，酬金就没有了。</seg>
<seg id="102">Now, he says I am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say.</seg>
<seg id="102">而今，他说我已经治愈了，但我说我的视力比以前更差了，我能证明我所说的。</seg>
<seg id="103">When my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough to be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other things;</seg>
<seg id="103">当我眼睛不好的时候，至少能看见屋子里的家具和其他东西；</seg>
<seg id="104">but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all."</seg>
<seg id="104">然而现在，照他说的我已经被治愈了，可我却根本看不见屋子里的任何东西了。”</seg>
<seg id="105">THE MOON AND HER MOTHER</seg>
<seg id="105">月亮和妈妈</seg>
<seg id="106">The Moon once begged her Mother to make her a gown.</seg>
<seg id="106">从前，月亮请求妈妈给它做一件礼服。</seg>
<seg id="107">"How can I?" replied she; "there's no fitting your figure.</seg>
<seg id="107">“我能怎么做呢？”妈妈说，“没有适合你身材的礼服。</seg>
<seg id="108">At one time you're a New Moon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're neither one nor the other."</seg>
<seg id="108">你一会儿是新月，一会儿是满月，还有既非新月也非满月的时候。”</seg>
<seg id="109">MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN</seg>
<seg id="109">墨丘利和樵夫</seg>
<seg id="110">A Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water.</seg>
<seg id="110">一个樵夫在河边砍树，突然他的斧子飞离了树干，失手落入河里。</seg>
<seg id="111">As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him the reason for his grief;</seg>
<seg id="111">正当他站在河边为自己的过失悲叹时，墨丘利出现了，问他为何而伤心，</seg>
<seg id="112">and on learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress he dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost.</seg>
<seg id="112">得知事情的缘由后，出于对樵夫的同情，墨丘利跳入河里，捞上来一把金灿灿的斧子，问他这是不是他丢失的那把斧子，</seg>
<seg id="113">The Woodman replied that it was not,</seg>
<seg id="113">樵夫回答说不是的。</seg>
<seg id="114">and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his.</seg>
<seg id="114">于是，墨丘利第二次跳入河里，捞上来一把银闪闪的斧子，问那是不是他的。</seg>
<seg id="115">"No, that is not mine either," said the Woodman.</seg>
<seg id="115">“不，那也不是我的。”樵夫说。</seg>
<seg id="116">Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe.</seg>
<seg id="116">墨丘利再次跳入河里，捞上来的正是樵夫丢失的那把斧子，</seg>
<seg id="117">The Woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly;</seg>
<seg id="117">樵夫看到失而复得的斧子欣喜若狂，对墨丘利感激万分。</seg>
<seg id="118">and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes.</seg>
<seg id="118">墨丘利非常欣赏樵夫的忠厚老实，就把另外两把斧子作为礼物送给了他。</seg>
<seg id="119">When the Woodman told the story to his companions, one of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined to try his luck for himself.</seg>
<seg id="119">樵夫把这件事告诉了他的伙伴们，其中有一个人非常妒忌他有这么好的运气，决定也去试试自己的运气。</seg>
<seg id="120">So he went and began to fell a tree at the edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop into the water.</seg>
<seg id="120">于是，他去河边砍树，并故意把斧子丢进河里。</seg>
<seg id="121">Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his axe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had done on the previous occasion.</seg>
<seg id="121">墨丘利像之前一样出现了，得知斧子掉入河里后，他像上次一样跳入河里，捞上来一把金斧子。</seg>
<seg id="122">Without waiting to be asked whether it was his or not the fellow cried, "That's mine, that's mine," and stretched out his hand eagerly for the prize:</seg>
<seg id="122">没等墨丘利问他这是不是他的，那家伙就大喊：“那是我的，是我的！”并伸手急切地想拿到金斧子。</seg>
<seg id="123">but Mercury was so disgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the golden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let fall into the stream.</seg>
<seg id="123">然而，墨丘利对他的不诚实深感厌恶，不仅拒绝给他金斧子，而且连他自己丢到河里的那把斧子也没有还给他。</seg>
<seg id="124">Honesty is the best policy.</seg>
<seg id="124">诚实至上。</seg>
<seg id="125">THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="125">驴、狐狸和狮子</seg>
<seg id="126">An Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together.</seg>
<seg id="126">驴和狐狸结伴出去觅食。</seg>
<seg id="127">They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened.</seg>
<seg id="127">它们没走多远，就看见一头狮子正向它们走来，它们都非常害怕。</seg>
<seg id="128">But the Fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the Lion and whispered in his ear, "I'll manage that you shall get hold of the Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free."</seg>
<seg id="128">然而，狐狸想到了一个可以救自己的办法，它大胆地走到狮子面前，在狮子耳边悄悄地说：“假如你答应放过我的话，我有办法使你不费劲就能抓到毛驴。”</seg>
<seg id="129">The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell.</seg>
<seg id="129">狮子同意了这个条件，狐狸回到它的同伴那儿，把驴引向猎人为捕获野兽而挖的一个陷阱，驴掉了进去。</seg>
<seg id="130">When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the Ass.</seg>
<seg id="130">狮子见驴被稳稳地抓住，无法逃跑了，它就首先把目标转向狐狸，立刻把狐狸吃了，然后继续优哉游哉地享用驴肉。</seg>

<seg id="132">狮子和老鼠</seg>
<seg id="133">A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face.</seg>
<seg id="133">狮子在巢穴里睡着了，一只老鼠跳到它的脸上，狮子被吵醒了。</seg>
<seg id="134">Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="134">狮子很生气，伸出爪子把老鼠抓住，想要吃了它。</seg>
<seg id="135">The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life.</seg>
<seg id="135">老鼠害怕极了，可怜地请求狮子饶命。</seg>
<seg id="136">"Please let me go," it cried, "and one day I will repay you for your kindness."</seg>
<seg id="136">“请放了我吧，”老鼠哭着说，“将来我会知恩图报的。”</seg>
<seg id="137">The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go.</seg>
<seg id="137">这么渺小的动物能为自己做什么事？狮子被这个想法逗乐了，大笑起来，于是和和气气地让老鼠走了。</seg>
<seg id="138">But the Mouse's chance came, after all.</seg>
<seg id="138">然而，老鼠报恩的机会终究来了。</seg>
<seg id="139">One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot.</seg>
<seg id="139">有一天，狮子掉入了猎人捕猎的网中，老鼠听到且辨认出了狮子的哀号，就跑到那个地方，</seg>
<seg id="140">Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free.</seg>
<seg id="140">没费多大力气就用牙齿咬破了绳索，在很短的时间内成功救出狮子。</seg>
<seg id="141">"There!" said the Mouse, "you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you:</seg>
<seg id="141">老鼠说：“我答应过会报答你的，你还嘲笑我呢，</seg>
<seg id="142">but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."</seg>
<seg id="142">然而，现在你明白了吧，即使一只老鼠也能帮助狮子。”</seg>
<seg id="143">THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</seg>
<seg id="143">乌鸦喝水</seg>
<seg id="144">A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy.</seg>
<seg id="144">一只口渴的乌鸦发现一口大水罐里盛着水，但是水罐里的水太少了，它尽力去啄还是够不到水，眼看着它就要渴死了。</seg>
<seg id="145">At last she hit upon a clever plan.</seg>
<seg id="145">终于，乌鸦突然想到了一个妙招。</seg>
<seg id="146">She began dropping pebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was enabled to quench her thirst.</seg>
<seg id="146">它衔来一些小圆石放进水罐里，每放一颗小圆石，水罐里的水就升高一点，直到漫到灌口为止，这只聪明的乌鸦终于喝上水了。</seg>
<seg id="147">Necessity is the mother of invention.</seg>

<seg id="148">男孩和青蛙</seg>
<seg id="149">Some mischievous Boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and, catching sight of some Frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they began to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed several of them.</seg>
<seg id="149">几个调皮的男孩在池塘边玩耍，突然看见水浅的地方有几只青蛙在蹦蹦跳跳。他们拿起石头扔向青蛙，以此来取乐，一连砸死了好几只青蛙。</seg>
<seg id="150">At last one of the Frogs put his head out of the water and said, "Oh, stop! stop!</seg>
<seg id="150">终于，有一只青蛙从水里伸出头来，对他们喊道：“噢，住手！住手！</seg>
<seg id="151">I beg of you:</seg>
<seg id="151">我求求你们！</seg>
<seg id="152">what is sport to you is death to us."</seg>
<seg id="152">你们的游戏会要了我们的命。”</seg>
<seg id="153">THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN</seg>
<seg id="153">北风和太阳</seg>
<seg id="154">A dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each claiming that he was stronger than the other.</seg>
<seg id="154">北风和太阳之间引起了一场争辩，都声称自己比别人更强大。</seg>
<seg id="155">At last they agreed to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his cloak.</seg>
<seg id="155">最终，它们决定试试自己对行人的威力，看看谁能最快使行人脱掉外衣。</seg>
<seg id="156">The North Wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling furiously down upon the man, and caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one single effort:</seg>
<seg id="156">北风首先一试身手，它使尽全力发威，对着地上的人们狂风大作，仿佛凭自己的力量就能卷走人们的衣服。</seg>
<seg id="157">but the harder he blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself.</seg>
<seg id="157">然而，风刮得越猛，人们把自己裹得越紧。</seg>
<seg id="158">Then came the turn of the Sun.</seg>
<seg id="158">接着，轮到太阳试身手了。</seg>
<seg id="159">At first he beamed gently upon the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders:</seg>
<seg id="159">起初，和煦的阳光照耀着行人，不久，人们解开外衣，边走边把衣服松松垮垮地搭在肩上；</seg>
<seg id="160">then he shone forth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey more lightly clad.</seg>
<seg id="160">接着，阳光四射，人们加快步伐，立刻高兴地脱掉外衣，更加轻松地享受他们的行程。</seg>
<seg id="161">Persuasion is better than force</seg>
<seg id="161">说服胜于暴力。</seg>
<seg id="162">THE MISTRESS AND HER SERVANTS</seg>
<seg id="162">女主人和仆人</seg>
<seg id="163">A Widow, thrifty and industrious, had two servants, whom she kept pretty hard at work.</seg>
<seg id="163">一个勤快节俭的寡妇请了两个雇工，一直让他们卖劲地干活。</seg>
<seg id="164">They were not allowed to lie long abed in the mornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock crew.</seg>
<seg id="164">早晨，他们不能在床上躺太久，老寡妇等公鸡一叫就催促他们起床干活。</seg>
<seg id="165">They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for the cock waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer.</seg>
<seg id="165">尤其是在冬天，他们极度讨厌在这样的时刻不得不起床，他们认为，要不是公鸡叫，女主人不会醒得那么早，他们就能多睡一会儿。</seg>
<seg id="166">So they caught it and wrung its neck.</seg>
<seg id="166">于是，他们抓住公鸡，扭断了它的脖子。</seg>
<seg id="167">But they weren't prepared for the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="167">然而，结果并非如他们所愿。</seg>
<seg id="168">For what happened was that their Mistress, not hearing the cock crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="168">因为，女主人没有像往常一样听到公鸡的叫声，反而比以前更早地叫醒他们，在半夜就让他们去干活了。</seg>
<seg id="169">THE GOODS AND THE ILLS</seg>
<seg id="169">善和恶</seg>
<seg id="170">There was a time in the youth of the world when Goods and Ills entered equally into the concerns of men, so that the Goods did not prevail to make them altogether blessed, nor the Ills to make them wholly miserable.</seg>
<seg id="170">很早以前，在世界刚创立不久，善和恶在人们眼中是一样的，以至于，善不能使人们完全幸福，恶也没有使人们完全不幸。</seg>
<seg id="171">But owing to the foolishness of mankind the Ills multiplied greatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though they would deprive the Goods of all share in human affairs, and banish them from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="171">但由于人类的愚昧，恶的数量大大增多了，能力增强了，直到它们似乎要夺走分摊到人类事物中的所有的善，把善从世间驱逐出去。</seg>
<seg id="172">The latter, therefore, betook themselves to heaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received, at the same time praying him to grant them protection from the Ills, and to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with men.</seg>
<seg id="172">为此，善来到天堂，向朱庇特抱怨自己所遭受的待遇，并请求朱庇特允许它们保护人类免受恶的伤害，朱庇特就它们与人类交往的方式提出了建议。</seg>
<seg id="173">Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that for the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so be liable to attack from the hostile Ills, but singly and unobserved, and at infrequent and unexpected intervals.</seg>
<seg id="173">他答应了善的请求，并命令它们今后不能一起公然地去人间，因为那样会容易受到敌对方——恶的攻击，而是要一个个悄悄地去，并且只是偶尔出其不意地去那里。</seg>
<seg id="174">Hence it is that the earth is full of Ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far away;</seg>
<seg id="174">从此以后，世间充满了恶，因为它们来去自由，从未走远；</seg>
<seg id="175">while Goods, alas! come one by one only, and have to travel all the way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.</seg>
<seg id="175">然而，善不得不一个一个地从天堂远道而来，以致非常罕见。</seg>
<seg id="176">THE HARES AND THE FROGS</seg>
<seg id="176">野兔和青蛙</seg>
<seg id="177">The Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own.</seg>
<seg id="177">有一次，野兔们聚集在一起，为自己不幸的命运而悲伤，因为周围处处都有危险，它们缺乏力量和勇气掌控自己的命运。</seg>
<seg id="178">Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily:</seg>
<seg id="178">人类、狗、鸟和野兽都是它们的敌人，每天都有野兔被捕杀，</seg>
<seg id="179">and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives.</seg>
<seg id="179">它们再也无法长期忍受这样的残害，一致决定结束自己卑微的生命。</seg>
<seg id="180">Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool, intending to drown themselves.</seg>
<seg id="180">于是，野兔们下定决心，不顾一切，急匆匆地朝附近的池塘里跳，想淹死自己。</seg>
<seg id="181">On the bank were sitting a number of Frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths.</seg>
<seg id="181">池塘边蹲着许多青蛙，一听到野兔向它们跑来的脚步声，立即都跳到水里，把自己藏在水深处。</seg>
<seg id="182">Then one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, "Stop, my friends, take heart;</seg>
<seg id="182">于是，一只比其他野兔聪明的老野兔就向它的同伴喊道：“停下来吧，朋友们，振作起来，</seg>
<seg id="183">don't let us destroy ourselves after all:</seg>
<seg id="183">总之我们不要自寻短见了。</seg>
<seg id="184">see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="184">瞧，这儿有些动物害怕我们呢，可见，它们肯定比我们更胆小。”</seg>
<seg id="185">THE FOX AND THE STORK</seg>
<seg id="185">狐狸和鹳</seg>
<seg id="186">A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup.</seg>
<seg id="186">狐狸请鹳吃饭，仅有的食物是一大平盘子的汤。</seg>
<seg id="187">The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth.</seg>
<seg id="187">狐狸舔着盘子享受美味。然而鹳用长长的嘴尖试着去喝汤，却是徒劳。</seg>
<seg id="188">Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement.</seg>
<seg id="188">鹳明显很苦恼，责怪狡猾的狐狸太捉弄人。</seg>
<seg id="189">But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease.</seg>
<seg id="189">然而不久后，轮到鹳邀请狐狸了，摆在狐狸面前的是一只长长的、口子很窄的大水罐，鹳用嘴轻而易举地就能够得着食物。</seg>
<seg id="190">Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.</seg>
<seg id="190">就这样，当鹳享用美味时，狐狸却在一旁饥饿无助地坐着，因为它够不到水罐里诱人的食物。</seg>
<seg id="191">THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING</seg>
<seg id="191">披着羊皮的狼</seg>
<seg id="192">A Wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey upon a flock of sheep without fear of detection.</seg>
<seg id="192">为了趁羊群不注意的时候捕食它们，狼决定伪装一下自己。</seg>
<seg id="193">So he clothed himself in a sheepskin, and slipped among the sheep when they were out at pasture.</seg>
<seg id="193">于是，狼披上一件羊皮的外衣，趁羊儿们在草地上吃草时，悄悄地混入其中。</seg>
<seg id="194">He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned for the night he was shut in with the rest.</seg>
<seg id="194">狼成功地骗过了牧羊人。夜晚，牧羊人把羊群关入羊栏中去休息了。</seg>
<seg id="195">But that very night as it happened, the shepherd, requiring a supply of mutton for the table, laid hands on the Wolf in mistake for a Sheep, and killed him with his knife on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="195">然而，在深夜时分，牧羊人需要羊肉作为晚餐，他伸手抓到狼，错以为是一只羊，当场就用刀把狼杀了。</seg>
<seg id="196">THE STAG IN THE OX-STALL</seg>
<seg id="196">牛栏里的鹿</seg>
<seg id="197">A Stag, chased from his lair by the hounds, took refuge in a farmyard, and, entering a stable where a number of oxen were stalled, thrust himself under a pile of hay in a vacant stall, where he lay concealed, all but the tips of his horns.</seg>
<seg id="197">一只鹿被猎犬从巢穴里追赶出来，它跑到一个农家宅院里避难，混进了牛栏里的一群牛中间，那里比较安全。鹿把自己塞进牛栏空闲处的一堆干草下面，躲藏在那儿，唯有鹿角露了出来。</seg>
<seg id="198">Presently one of the Oxen said to him, "What has induced you to come in here?</seg>
<seg id="198">不一会儿，一头牛对它说：“你为什么到这儿来？</seg>
<seg id="199">Aren't you aware of the risk you are running of being captured by the herdsmen?"</seg>
<seg id="199">你没有意识到跑这儿来，会有被牧人俘获的危险吗？”</seg>
<seg id="200">To which he replied, "Pray let me stay for the present.</seg>
<seg id="200">鹿对那头牛答道：“请让我暂时待在这儿吧。</seg>
<seg id="201">When night comes I shall easily escape under cover of the dark."</seg>
<seg id="201">当夜晚来临时，我将会在夜色的掩护下毫不费力地逃走。”</seg>
<seg id="202">In the course of the afternoon more than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of the cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the Stag, who accordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express his gratitude to the Oxen.</seg>
<seg id="202">下午，不止一个农场工人到这里来照看牛群的所需，但没有一个人注意到鹿的存在，鹿因此庆幸自己逃过了一劫，并向牛表示感谢。</seg>
<seg id="203">"We wish you well," said the one who had spoken before, "but you are not out of danger yet.</seg>
<seg id="203">“我们希望你安全，”之前劝告过它的其中一头牛说，“但你还没有脱离危险。</seg>
<seg id="204">If the master comes, you will certainly be found out, for nothing ever escapes his keen eyes."</seg>
<seg id="204">如果主人来了，你肯定会被发现，因为从来没有东西能逃过他锐利的眼睛。”</seg>
<seg id="205">Presently, sure enough, in he came, and made a great to-do about the way the Oxen were kept.</seg>
<seg id="205">没过多久，主人果然来了，他仔细查看了牛栏周围的情况。</seg>
<seg id="206">"The beasts are starving," he cried; "here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them."</seg>
<seg id="206">“牲畜们饿了，”他喊道，“给它们添些干草，在它们下面多放一些。”</seg>
<seg id="207">As he spoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the Stag lay concealed, and at once detected him.</seg>
<seg id="207">就在说话的时候，他从鹿躲藏的草堆里抓起一抱干草，立刻就发现了鹿。</seg>
<seg id="208">Calling his men, he had him seized at once and killed for the table.</seg>
<seg id="208">他喊来工人，吩咐他们当即抓住鹿，并把它杀掉吃了。</seg>
<seg id="209">THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL</seg>
<seg id="209">挤牛奶的姑娘</seg>
<seg id="210">A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head.</seg>
<seg id="210">一个农家女孩把牛奶挤出来后，头顶着奶桶把牛奶送到乳品店去。</seg>
<seg id="211">As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: "The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell.</seg>
<seg id="211">她走着走着，看到了一件漂亮衣服，于是她有了一个有趣的想法：“把这桶牛奶变成奶油，然后我做成黄油拿到集市上去出售。</seg>
<seg id="212">With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry-yard.</seg>
<seg id="212">换成钱后，我要买许多鸡蛋，各种各样的，然后孵出鸡来，不久我将会有一家相当大的饲养场。</seg>
<seg id="213">Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair;</seg>
<seg id="213">然后，我就卖掉一些鸡，用这些钱给自己买一件新衣服。当我去集市的时候，穿上这件新衣，</seg>
<seg id="214">and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them."</seg>
<seg id="214">所有年轻小伙儿都会为之倾倒，然后来追求我，并爱上我，但是我会摇头对他们一声不吭。”</seg>
<seg id="215">Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head.</seg>
<seg id="215">想着想着，她忘乎所以地摇起头来。</seg>
<seg id="216">Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!</seg>
<seg id="216">桶跌落下来，牛奶都流了出去，她美好的想象顷刻消失了！</seg>
<seg id="217">Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.</seg>
<seg id="217">不要过早打如意算盘。</seg>
<seg id="218">THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT</seg>
<seg id="218">海豚、鲸鱼和鲱鱼</seg>
<seg id="219">The Dolphins quarrelled with the Whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another.</seg>
<seg id="219">海豚和鲸鱼发生了争吵，不一会儿，它们打斗起来，</seg>
<seg id="220">The battle was very fierce, and had lasted some time without any sign of coming to an end, when a Sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it;</seg>
<seg id="220">交战非常激烈，持续了一段时间之后仍没有任何结束的迹象。这时，一条鲱鱼觉得，或许自己能劝战，</seg>
<seg id="221">so he stepped in and tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">于是游了过去，试着劝服海豚和鲸鱼放弃战斗，化敌为友。</seg>
<seg id="222">But one of the Dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a Sprat like you!"</seg>
<seg id="222">然而，海豚轻蔑地对它说：“我们宁愿决一死战，也不愿让一条像你这样的鲱鱼来做调解！”</seg>
<seg id="223">THE FOX AND THE MONKEY</seg>
<seg id="223">狐狸和猴子</seg>
<seg id="224">A Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born.</seg>
<seg id="224">狐狸和猴子一同走在路上，相互争论谁的出身更高贵。</seg>
<seg id="225">They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh.</seg>
<seg id="225">争论了一会儿，它们来到途中一处墓碑林立的墓地，猴子停下来看着狐狸，发出一声长叹。</seg>
<seg id="226">"Why do you sigh?" said the Fox.</seg>
<seg id="226">“你为什么叹气？”狐狸问。</seg>
<seg id="227">The Monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men."</seg>
<seg id="227">猴子指着墓穴回答：“你在这儿看见的所有墓碑，都是为了纪念我的祖先而立的，他们当时都是名人。”</seg>
<seg id="228">The Fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! don't stop at any lie, sir;</seg>
<seg id="228">狐狸愣了一会儿，但很快接着说：“噢，先生，尽管胡说八道吧，</seg>
<seg id="229">you're quite safe:</seg>
<seg id="229">你非常安全，</seg>
<seg id="230">I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."</seg>
<seg id="230">因为我确信你的先辈没有一个会站起来揭发你的。”</seg>
<seg id="231">Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.</seg>
<seg id="231">吹嘘者在自以为无人知晓的情况下吹嘘得最夸张。</seg>
<seg id="232">THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOG</seg>
<seg id="232">驴和哈巴狗</seg>
<seg id="233">There was once a man who had an Ass and a Lap-dog.</seg>
<seg id="233">从前，有个人养了一头驴和一只哈巴狗。</seg>
<seg id="234">The Ass was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off as an ass could be.</seg>
<seg id="234">养在槽厩里的驴有很多燕麦和干草吃，觉得自己非常幸运。</seg>
<seg id="235">The little Dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap;</seg>
<seg id="235">小狗深得主人宠爱，主人经常抚摸它，让它在脚边躺着。</seg>
<seg id="236">and if he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return.</seg>
<seg id="236">如果主人到外面去吃饭，当小狗跑过去迎接主人回来的时候，主人会把带回来的一点食物给它。</seg>
<seg id="237">The Ass had, it is true, a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm:</seg>
<seg id="237">驴确实有很多工作要做，磨稻谷或运输庄稼。</seg>
<seg id="238">and ere long he became very jealous, contrasting his own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the Lap-dog.</seg>
<seg id="238">驴把自己的劳作生活与哈巴狗的舒适闲散相对比，不久，它就嫉妒得要命。</seg>
<seg id="239">At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts.</seg>
<seg id="239">终于有一天，驴挣脱了缰绳，蹦蹦跳跳地来到房间里，恰好主人正坐下来吃饭，驴模仿小哈巴狗的可爱样子围着主人欢蹦乱跳，可它那笨拙的蛮劲儿踢翻了桌子、打碎了陶器，</seg>
<seg id="240">Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog allowed to do.</seg>
<seg id="240">它甚至试图蹦到主人的腿上去，就像它经常瞧见哈巴狗做的那样。</seg>
<seg id="241">At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belaboured the silly Ass with sticks and cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating.</seg>
<seg id="241">仆人们见主人有危险，就用棍棒狠狠地打了这头蠢驴，把它赶回槽厩，驴被打得半死。</seg>
<seg id="242">"Alas!" he cried, "all this I have brought on myself.</seg>
<seg id="242">“哎呀！”驴哭喊道，“这都是我自作自受。</seg>

<seg id="246">瞧我，我可以派作各种各样的用途，尤其当人们造房子时，没有我，他们什么也干不了。”</seg>

<seg id="367">你踮起后腿，把前腿靠在井壁上放稳，然后我爬到你的背上，从那儿跨到你的角上，我就能出去了。</seg>
<seg id="368">And when I'm out, I'll help you out too."</seg>
<seg id="368">当我出去后，我也会帮你逃出去的。”</seg>
<seg id="369">The Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away.</seg>
<seg id="369">山羊照狐狸说的做了，狐狸爬到山羊的背上，从井里逃了出来，然后就冷漠地离开了。</seg>
<seg id="370">The Goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out:</seg>
<seg id="370">山羊在狐狸身后大喊，叫它要记得自己的承诺，</seg>
<seg id="371">but the Fox merely turned and said, "If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again."</seg>
<seg id="371">然而狐狸只是回过头说：“如果你脑袋里的智慧像你的胡须一样多，你就不会没看清出路，就跳进井里。”</seg>
<seg id="372">Look before your leap.</seg>
<seg id="372">三思而后行。</seg>
<seg id="373">THE FISHERMAN AND THE SPRAT</seg>
<seg id="373">渔夫和鲱鱼</seg>
<seg id="374">A Fisherman cast his net into the sea, and when he drew it up again it contained nothing but a single Sprat that begged to be put back into the water.</seg>
<seg id="374">渔夫把网撒到海里，当他收网时，网里除了一条小鲱鱼，什么也没有。小鲱鱼请求渔夫把它放回海里。</seg>
<seg id="375">"I'm only a little fish now," it said, "but I shall grow big one day, and then if you come and catch me again I shall be of some use to you."</seg>
<seg id="375">“我现在只是一条小鱼，”鲱鱼说，“但总有一天我会长成一条大鱼，如果那时你再抓到我，将对你更有利。”</seg>
<seg id="376">But the Fisherman replied, "Oh, no, I shall keep you now I've got you:</seg>
<seg id="376">然而，渔夫回答：“噢，不，我现在已经得到你了，</seg>
<seg id="377">if I put you back, should I ever see you again?</seg>
<seg id="377">如果我放你回去，还能再见到你吗？</seg>

<seg id="381">Among other things, he said he had taken part in a jumping-match at Rhodes, and had done a wonderful jump which no one could beat.</seg>
<seg id="381">除了别的事之外，他说，他在罗得岛参加过一次跳远比赛，他那精彩的一跳没人能比。</seg>
<seg id="382">"Just go to Rhodes and ask them," he said; "every one will tell you it's true."</seg>
<seg id="382">“你们去罗得岛问他们，”他说，“人人都会告诉你这是真的。”</seg>
<seg id="383">But one of those who were listening said, "If you can jump as well as all that, we needn't go to Rhodes to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="383">然而，听众里有一个人说：“如果你真像你所说的跳得那么好，我们不需要去罗得岛求证。</seg>
<seg id="384">Let's just imagine this is Rhodes for a minute: and now--jump!"</seg>
<seg id="384">此刻，就把这里当作罗得岛，现在就跳吧！”</seg>

<seg id="389">小蟹回答：“亲爱的妈妈，你教我怎么走，我会学你的样子。”</seg>
<seg id="390">The Old Crab tried, but tried in vain, and then saw how foolish she had been to find fault with her child.</seg>
<seg id="390">母蟹试着直走，但根本不行。于是，小蟹发现妈妈很笨。</seg>

<seg id="394">天气非常炎热，他们走了没多久就停下来休息。旅行者想躺在驴的影子下，</seg>
<seg id="395">but the owner, who himself wished to be out of the sun, wouldn't let him do that;</seg>
<seg id="395">而驴的主人也想遮阳，不愿让旅行者独占阴凉。</seg>
<seg id="396">for he said he had hired the Ass only, and not his Shadow:</seg>
<seg id="396">他说，旅行者只是租了驴，不包括驴的影子。</seg>
<seg id="397">the other maintained that his bargain secured him complete control of the Ass for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="397">旅行者坚持认为，他的租用协议规定他在此期间可以完全掌控驴。</seg>

<seg id="404">As soon as their father was dead, the Sons took spade and fork and turned up the soil of the vineyard over and over again, in their search for the treasure which they supposed to lie buried there.</seg>
<seg id="404">不久，农夫过世了，他的孩子们拿着铁锹和耙子把葡萄园里的土壤翻了个遍，他们费力寻找，以为那儿藏有宝藏。</seg>
<seg id="405">They found none, however: but the vines, after so thorough a digging, produced a crop such as had never before been seen.</seg>

<seg id="408">His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite another Dog, a friend of his;</seg>
<seg id="408">他的狗就想，这是一个邀请它的朋友——另一只狗的好机会，</seg>
<seg id="409">so he went to him and said, "My master is giving a feast:</seg>
<seg id="409">它对那只狗说：“我的主人正要举办一场宴会，</seg>
<seg id="410">there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me to-night."</seg>
<seg id="410">那将是一场豪华的盛宴，今晚你过来和我一起去吃。”</seg>
<seg id="411">The Dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations being made in the kitchen he said to himself, "My word, I'm in luck:</seg>
<seg id="411">于是，狗应邀前来，它看见厨房里准备的食物时，自言自语道：“哎呀，我真幸运，</seg>
<seg id="412">I'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days."</seg>
<seg id="412">今晚我要吃个饱，够撑个两三天的了。”</seg>
<seg id="413">At the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his friend how delighted he was to have been asked.</seg>
<seg id="413">狗欢快地摇着尾巴，向它的朋友表示受到邀请别提有多高兴了。</seg>
<seg id="414">But just then the Cook caught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange Dog in the kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="414">然而，就在这时，厨师突然发现了它。在厨房里看到一条陌生的狗不禁令人生厌，厨师抓起狗的后腿，把它扔到了窗外。</seg>
<seg id="415">He had a nasty fall, and limped away as quickly as he could, howling dismally.</seg>
<seg id="415">狗摔了个嘴啃泥，它低声哀号着，以最快的速度一瘸一拐地离去。</seg>
<seg id="416">Presently some other dogs met him, and said, "Well, what sort of a dinner did you get?"</seg>
<seg id="416">不一会儿，几只其他的狗遇见它，问道：“你在宴会上吃了些什么？”</seg>
<seg id="417">To which he replied, "I had a splendid time:</seg>
<seg id="417">它回答说：“我度过了一段美妙的时光，</seg>
<seg id="418">the wine was so good, and I drank so much of it, that I really don't remember how I got out of the house!"</seg>

<seg id="422">When they were preparing their supper, one of them caught up the Cock, and was about to wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and said, "Pray do not kill me:</seg>
<seg id="422">当他们准备晚餐时，其中一个小偷抓住公鸡，拧着它的脖子。公鸡可怜兮兮地哭喊道：“请不要杀我，</seg>
<seg id="423">you will find me a most useful bird, for I rouse honest men to their work in the morning by my crowing."</seg>
<seg id="423">你们会发现我是最有用的家禽，因为我在早晨会叫醒诚实的人们起来去工作。”</seg>
<seg id="424">But the Thief replied with some heat, "Yes, I know you do, making it still harder for us to get a livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="424">但小偷略微有些激动地说：“是啊，我知道你会打鸣，这样更是坏了我们的生计。</seg>

<seg id="441">So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means.</seg>
<seg id="441">因此，他决定通过下面的方法让儿子们认识到自己的愚蠢。</seg>
<seg id="442">Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee.</seg>
<seg id="442">他叫儿子们取来一捆柴枝，让他们每个人轮着把这捆柴枝搁在膝盖上折断。</seg>
<seg id="443">All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them.</seg>
<seg id="443">儿子们试了试都失败了，于是他解开那捆柴枝，给儿子们一人一根，他们全都毫不费力地把柴枝折断了。</seg>
<seg id="444">"There, my boys," said he, "united you will be more than a match for your enemies:</seg>
<seg id="444">“你们看，孩子们，”他说，“团结起来，你们就能胜过敌人，</seg>
<seg id="445">but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy of those who attack you."</seg>

<seg id="447">THE LAMP</seg>
<seg id="447">油灯</seg>
<seg id="448">A Lamp, well filled with oil, burned with a clear and steady light, and began to swell with pride and boast that it shone more brightly than the sun himself.</seg>
<seg id="448">一盏灯，注满了油，发出明亮稳定的光，于是得意洋洋起来，吹嘘自己发出的光芒比太阳还亮。</seg>

<seg id="453">The Owl is a very wise bird;</seg>
<seg id="453">从前，猫头鹰是一只非常聪明的鸟。</seg>
<seg id="454">and once, long ago, when the first oak sprouted in the forest, she called all the other Birds together and said to them, "You see this tiny tree?</seg>
<seg id="454">当森林里第一棵橡树萌发新叶的时候，猫头鹰就叫来所有其他的鸟儿，对它们说：“你们看到这棵小树了吗？</seg>
<seg id="455">If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small:</seg>
<seg id="455">如果你们接受我的劝告，在这棵树还小的时候，你们就要把它砍掉，</seg>
<seg id="456">for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction."</seg>
<seg id="456">因为这棵树长大了，就会有槲寄生出现，那里会滋生出粘鸟胶，因此你们要砍掉它。”</seg>
<seg id="457">Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, "Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you."</seg>
<seg id="457">还有一次，当第一粒亚麻播种的时候，猫头鹰对鸟儿们说：“去把那些种子吃了，因为亚麻种子发芽长大后，有一天人们会用亚麻织成网来逮住你们。”</seg>
<seg id="458">Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them.</seg>
<seg id="458">又有一次，当猫头鹰第一眼看见弓箭手时，就警告鸟儿们，弓箭手是鸟类致命的敌人，他会用鸟的羽毛做成的箭，来射杀鸟类。</seg>
<seg id="459">But they took no notice of what she said:</seg>
<seg id="459">但是，鸟儿们都没有把猫头鹰的话当回事。</seg>
<seg id="460">in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her.</seg>
<seg id="460">它们认为猫头鹰想得太多了，还嘲笑猫头鹰。</seg>
<seg id="461">When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="461">然而，每件事都证实了猫头鹰的预言，鸟儿们转变了想法，对猫头鹰的聪明才智推崇备至。</seg>
<seg id="462">Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good.</seg>
<seg id="462">从那以后，每当猫头鹰出现，鸟儿们就跟随它左右，希望听到一些或许对自己有利的事。</seg>
<seg id="463">She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.</seg>
<seg id="463">可是，猫头鹰不再给它们劝告了，而是闷闷不乐地栖息在树上，思考着自己曾经善意的愚蠢行为。</seg>

<seg id="466">所有的人和动物见了它，都吓坏了，大家都把它当成了一头狮子，看见它走过来，纷纷逃之夭夭。</seg>

<seg id="468">狐狸听到叫声，立刻认出了驴，并对它说：“啊哈，朋友，这不是你吗？</seg>

<seg id="470">母山羊和胡须</seg>
<seg id="471">Jupiter granted beards to the She-Goats at their own request, much to the disgust of the he-Goats, who considered this to be an unwarrantable invasion of their rights and dignities.</seg>
<seg id="471">朱庇特应母山羊的请求，答应给它们胡须。公山羊对此极为不满，认为这无疑侵犯了自己的权利和尊严。</seg>
<seg id="472">So they sent a deputation to him to protest against his action.</seg>
<seg id="472">于是，公山羊派出代表，向朱庇特表示抗议。</seg>
<seg id="473">He, however, advised them not to raise any objections.</seg>

<seg id="474">“一簇毛发算得了什么？”朱庇特说，“如果母山羊想要，就让它们有吧。</seg>

<seg id="477">A Lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself by force, determined to do so by cunning.</seg>
<seg id="477">一头年老体弱的狮子，已经无力再为自己觅食了，它决定用狡猾的方式来获取食物。</seg>
<seg id="478">Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick:</seg>

<seg id="479">and whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them.</seg>
<seg id="479">每当其他动物来到洞里，问候狮子的健康状况时，狮子就扑到它们身上，狼吞虎咽地把它们吃了。</seg>

<seg id="480">很多动物就这样丢了性命。直到有一天，狐狸到洞穴来探望，它对狮子的真实健康状况有点怀疑，狐狸没有进洞，而是站在洞穴外与狮子对话，问它怎么样了。</seg>
<seg id="481">He replied that he was in a very bad way:</seg>
<seg id="481">狮子回答说，自己处于非常糟糕的境地。</seg>
<seg id="482">"But," said he, "why do you stand outside?</seg>
<seg id="482">“但是，”狮子说，“你为什么站在外面？</seg>
<seg id="483">Pray come in."</seg>
<seg id="483">请进来吧。”</seg>
<seg id="484">"I should have done so," answered the Fox, "if I hadn't noticed that all the footprints point towards the cave and none the other way."</seg>

<seg id="497">狐狸为自己的发现欣喜若狂，它通过一条狭窄的缝隙溜了进去，狼吞虎咽地把食物吃了个精光。</seg>
<seg id="498">But when he tried to get out again he found himself so swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the hole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune.</seg>
<seg id="498">但是，当狐狸试图出来时，发现自己饱餐后肚子胀得鼓鼓的，它从树洞里挤不出去了，于是为自己的不幸遭遇哀号呻吟起来。</seg>
<seg id="499">Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was;</seg>
<seg id="499">另一只狐狸经过那儿，听到了它的呻吟，就过来问它怎么回事，</seg>

<seg id="504">为了使它们永不分离，青蛙在自己和老鼠的腿上系了一根线绳，</seg>

<seg id="506">but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in, taking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="506">但是，当它们来到水池边，青蛙跳了进去，把老鼠一起带了下去，青蛙游得畅快，高兴得“呱呱呱”地叫。</seg>
<seg id="507">The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the Frog.</seg>
<seg id="507">然而，不幸的老鼠很快被淹死了，尸体随着青蛙漂浮在水面上。</seg>

<seg id="512">他被刺得非常疼，就跑回去告诉妈妈。男孩哭着对妈妈说：“妈妈，我只是轻轻地碰了它一下。”</seg>
<seg id="513">"That's just why you got stung, my son," she said;</seg>

<seg id="515">农夫和苹果树</seg>

<seg id="516">农夫的果园里有一棵长势良好但不结果实的苹果树，只能为栖息在树枝上叽叽喳喳的麻雀和蚱蜢提供一处遮挡炎热的荫凉。</seg>
<seg id="517">Disappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his axe for the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="517">农夫对苹果树不能结果非常失望，决定砍掉它，为此取来了斧头。</seg>
<seg id="518">But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, "If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden."</seg>
<seg id="518">然而，麻雀和蚱蜢看到农夫要砍苹果树，请求农夫不要这么做，它们对农夫说：“如果你砍了这棵树，我们不得不到其他地方去寻找荫凉，你将再也听不到我们为你在果园里劳作时的放声欢歌。”</seg>
<seg id="519">He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk.</seg>
<seg id="519">然而，农夫不顾它们的请求，仍然往树枝上砍。</seg>
<seg id="520">A few strokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store of honey.</seg>
<seg id="520">几斧头砍下去，树干上露出了一个洞，里面有一群蜜蜂，并贮存着许多蜂蜜。</seg>
<seg id="521">Delighted with his find he threw down his axe, saying, "The old tree is worth keeping after all."</seg>
<seg id="521">农夫为这一发现欣喜若狂，他扔了斧头，说：“这棵老树毕竟还是值得留下来的。”</seg>

<seg id="524">有只寒鸦瞧见农庄里有一些鸽子，当它看到鸽子被喂养得很好，它就非常羡慕，于是决定把自己装扮成鸽群中的一员，以得到一份鸽子们享用的丰盛食物。</seg>
<seg id="525">So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock;</seg>
<seg id="525">于是，寒鸦把自己从头到脚涂成白色，混进鸽群中，</seg>
<seg id="526">and, so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeon like themselves.</seg>
<seg id="526">只要它不吭声，鸽子永远不会怀疑它是冒牌货。</seg>
<seg id="527">But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again.</seg>
<seg id="527">然而，有一天，寒鸦愚蠢地开始喋喋不休，鸽子们立刻看出寒鸦是假扮的，于是毫不留情地啄赶它。寒鸦得以幸运地逃脱，再次回到自己的寒鸦群中。</seg>
<seg id="528">But the other jackdaws did not recognise him in his white dress, and would not let him feed with them, but drove him away:</seg>
<seg id="528">然而，其他寒鸦因为它的一身白装，认不出它来了，不让它一起分享食物，鸽子也离它远远的。</seg>

<seg id="533">第二天，朱庇特见到乌龟时便问它为什么不来参加婚宴。</seg>
<seg id="534">"I don't care for going out," said the Tortoise; "there's no place like home."</seg>
<seg id="534">“我不喜欢出门，”乌龟说，“金屋银屋，不如自己家的草屋。”</seg>
<seg id="535">Jupiter was so much annoyed by this reply that he decreed that from that time forth the Tortoise should carry his house upon his back, and never be able to get away from home even if he wished to.</seg>

<seg id="537">一条狗躺在食槽里的干草上，放在那里的干草是为牛准备的口粮，当牛儿们过来想吃草的时候，狗对着它们龇牙咧嘴地汪汪直叫，不让它们吃草。</seg>

<seg id="550">一个男孩把手伸进装有榛果的瓶子里，尽可能地想抓一大把。</seg>

<seg id="558">so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to give them a King.</seg>
<seg id="558">于是派代表求见天神朱庇特，请求赐给它们一个国王。</seg>
<seg id="559">Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast a log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be their King.</seg>
<seg id="559">朱庇特鄙视它们的请求，觉得这是如此愚蠢，就往池塘里扔了一块木头，说那就是它们的国王。</seg>

<seg id="560">青蛙起初被木头溅起的水声吓倒了，急忙逃到池塘深处。</seg>
<seg id="561">but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it.</seg>
<seg id="561">过了没多久，它们发现木头依然没有动静，马上壮着胆子钻出水面，很快，它们的胆子越来越大，并瞧不起木头，甚至蹲坐在上面。</seg>
<seg id="562">Thinking that a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one.</seg>
<seg id="562">青蛙认为，这样一个国王有辱它们的尊严。它们再次去见朱庇特，请朱庇特把这个愚钝的国王带走，另外赐给它们一个更好的国王。</seg>

<seg id="574">过了一会儿，双方因为要喘息片刻，停止了打斗。它们瞧见几只秃鹫停在一块石头上，显然在等着它们中伤亡的一方，那时，秃鹫就会直扑下来，以尸体为食。</seg>

<seg id="592">但乌龟再三恳求并重金承诺，坚持认为那只是一个在空中生存的本领。</seg>

<seg id="604">“无论从哪个角度来说，尾巴是很难看的，”它说，“而且还很重，讨厌的是你一直要带着它们。”</seg>

<seg id="615">快点，都准备好了，</seg>
<seg id="616">I mean you to go with me."</seg>
<seg id="616">我要你跟我一起去。”</seg>
<seg id="617">But the Dog merely wagged his tail and said quietly, "I'm ready, master:</seg>
<seg id="617">然而，狗轻轻地摇摇尾巴，淡定地说：“主人，我已经准备好了，</seg>
<seg id="618">it's you I'm waiting for."</seg>
<seg id="618">正在等您呢。”</seg>
<seg id="619">THE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA</seg>
<seg id="619">大海和遭遇海难的人</seg>
<seg id="620">A Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle with the waves.</seg>
<seg id="620">一个遭遇海难的人被冲到沙滩上，经过一番与海浪的搏击后，他累得睡着了。</seg>
<seg id="621">When he woke up, he bitterly reproached the Sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface, and then, when they were well embarked, turning in fury upon them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction.</seg>
<seg id="621">他醒来后，怒斥大海起初以风平浪静的海面诱惑人们，而后却背信弃义。当他们在海上航行时，大海突然对他们暴怒，使船和海员都掉入大海。</seg>
<seg id="622">The Sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, "Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds.</seg>
<seg id="622">大海变成一个妇人的样子，回答他：“噢，海员，不要责怪我，那要怪风。</seg>
<seg id="623">By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself:</seg>
<seg id="623">因为我的天性如同陆地一样平静，</seg>
<seg id="624">but the Winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me."</seg>
<seg id="624">而狂风落在我的身上，激怒了我，那不是我的本意啊。”</seg>

<seg id="625">野猪和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="626">A Wild Boar was engaged in whetting his tusks upon the trunk of a tree in the forest when a Fox came by and, seeing what he was at, said to him, "Why are you doing that, pray?</seg>
<seg id="626">森林里，一只野猪靠着树干正在磨牙，一只狐狸过来看见了，对它说：“请问你为什么磨牙？</seg>
<seg id="627">The huntsmen are not out to-day, and there are no other dangers at hand that I can see."</seg>
<seg id="627">猎人今天不在，我看附近也没有其他危险。”</seg>
<seg id="628">"True, my friend," replied the Boar, "but the instant my life is in danger I shall need to use my tusks.</seg>
<seg id="628">“确实如此，朋友，”野猪回答，“但是，我的性命随时会处于危险中，我得随时用上我的牙齿，</seg>
<seg id="629">There'll be no time to sharpen them then."</seg>

<seg id="630">墨丘利和雕刻师</seg>
<seg id="631">Mercury was very anxious to know in what estimation he was held by mankind;</seg>
<seg id="631">墨丘利非常想知道世人对他有多尊敬，</seg>

<seg id="632">于是扮成凡人，来到一家雕刻师的工作室，那儿有许多成品的雕像等着出售。</seg>
<seg id="633">Seeing a statue of Jupiter among the rest, he inquired the price of it.</seg>
<seg id="633">他看到朱庇特的雕像，问要多少钱。</seg>
<seg id="634">"A crown," said the Sculptor.</seg>
<seg id="634">“一克朗。”雕刻师说。</seg>
<seg id="635">"Is that all?" said he, laughing;</seg>
<seg id="635">“就这些吗？”他笑着说，</seg>
<seg id="636">"and" (pointing to one of Juno) "how much is that one?"</seg>
<seg id="636">“还有，”他指着一尊朱庇特之妻朱诺的雕像，“这尊多少钱？”</seg>
<seg id="637">"That," was the reply, "is half a crown."</seg>
<seg id="637">“那个，”雕刻师回答，“半克朗。”</seg>
<seg id="638">"And how much might you be wanting for that one over there, now?" he continued, pointing to a statue of himself.</seg>
<seg id="638">“你对这尊雕像的要价可能比其他雕像更高吧？”墨丘利指着自己的雕像继续问道。</seg>
<seg id="639">"That one?" said the Sculptor;</seg>
<seg id="639">“是那尊吗？”雕刻师说，</seg>
<seg id="640">"Oh, I'll throw him in for nothing if you'll buy the other two."</seg>

<seg id="642">A Hind said to her Fawn, who was now well grown and strong, "My son, Nature has given you a powerful body and a stout pair of horns, and I can't think why you are such a coward as to run away from the hounds."</seg>
<seg id="642">母鹿对已成年的小鹿说：“儿子，大自然赋予你强健的身体和一对结实的鹿角，我不能想象，为什么你是这样的一个胆小鬼，猎犬一来，你就要逃跑？”</seg>
<seg id="643">Just then they both heard the sound of a pack in full cry, but at a considerable distance.</seg>
<seg id="643">正在此时，母子俩听到远处有一群猎犬正狂追猛赶地冲它们而来。</seg>
<seg id="644">"You stay where you are," said the Hind; "never mind me":</seg>
<seg id="644">“你就待在这里，”母鹿说，“不用担心我。”</seg>
<seg id="645">and with that she ran off as fast as her legs could carry her.</seg>
<seg id="645">说着它飞快地拔腿跑了。</seg>
<seg id="646">THE FOX AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="646">狐狸和狮子</seg>

<seg id="648">After a time he met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so much as he had been when he met him first.</seg>
<seg id="648">过了一阵子，狐狸又遇见狮子，仍然有些害怕，但已经比第一次遇见时好多了。</seg>
<seg id="649">But when he saw him for the third time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and began to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.</seg>
<seg id="649">当狐狸第三次看见狮子时，它非但不害怕，反而走到狮子跟前，像早已认识的朋友那样和狮子聊起天来。</seg>

<seg id="651">A Man once caught an Eagle, and after clipping his wings turned him loose among the fowls in his hen-house, where he moped in a corner, looking very dejected and forlorn.</seg>
<seg id="651">从前，有人捕到了一只鹰，他剪下鹰的翅膀，把鹰放进鸡窝里的家禽当中。鹰在那儿暗自神伤，看上去非常孤独沮丧。</seg>
<seg id="652">After a while his Captor was glad enough to sell him to a neighbour, who took him home and let his wings grow again.</seg>
<seg id="652">不久，捕鹰人高兴地把鹰卖给了邻居，邻居把鹰带回家，并让鹰的翅膀又重新长了出来。</seg>
<seg id="653">As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the Eagle flew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his benefactor.</seg>
<seg id="653">翅膀一复原，鹰就直冲云霄，抓了一只野兔带回家送给它的恩人。</seg>
<seg id="654">A fox observed this, and said to the Eagle, "Don't waste your gifts on him!</seg>
<seg id="654">一只狐狸见状，对鹰说：“不要把礼物给这个人！</seg>
<seg id="655">Go and give them to the man who first caught you; make him your friend, and then perhaps he won't catch you and clip your wings a second time."</seg>
<seg id="655">你要去把礼物给起先捕捉你的人，使他成为你的朋友。或许，他就不会再来捕捉你，并剪掉你的翅膀了。”</seg>
<seg id="656">THE BLACKSMITH AND HIS DOG</seg>
<seg id="656">铁匠和小狗</seg>
<seg id="657">A Blacksmith had a little Dog, which used to sleep when his master was at work, but was very wide awake indeed when it was time for meals.</seg>
<seg id="657">铁匠养了一只小狗，这只小狗常常在主人工作的时候睡觉，但到了吃饭的时间必定精神十足。</seg>
<seg id="658">One day his master pretended to be disgusted at this, and when he had thrown him a bone as usual, he said, "What on earth is the good of a lazy cur like you?</seg>
<seg id="658">有一天，主人假装对小狗的行为表示厌恶，他像往常一样扔给小狗一块骨头，说：“像你这么懒的杂种狗究竟有什么好？</seg>
<seg id="659">When I am hammering away at my anvil, you just curl up and go to sleep:</seg>
<seg id="659">我在铁砧上捶打时，你正好蜷起身子睡觉；</seg>
<seg id="660">but no sooner do I stop for a mouthful of food than you wake up and wag your tail to be fed."</seg>
<seg id="660">而当我一旦停下来，吃点东西时，你就立即醒来摇着尾巴要吃的。”</seg>
<seg id="661">Those who will not work deserve to starve.</seg>
<seg id="661">劳动者该得食，不劳者该挨饿。</seg>
<seg id="662">THE STAG AT THE POOL</seg>
<seg id="662">池塘边的雄鹿</seg>
<seg id="663">A thirsty Stag went down to a pool to drink.</seg>
<seg id="663">一头口渴的雄鹿来到池塘边喝水。</seg>
<seg id="664">As he bent over the surface he saw his own reflection in the water, and was struck with admiration for his fine spreading antlers, but at the same time he felt nothing but disgust for the weakness and slenderness of his legs.</seg>
<seg id="664">当它弯下腰，凑近水面时，看见了自己在水中的倒影，它对自己美丽挺拔的鹿角非常欣赏，但同时对自己纤细修长的腿感到莫名地嫌弃。</seg>
<seg id="665">While he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by a Lion;</seg>
<seg id="665">正当雄鹿在那儿打量自己的时候，一头狮子发现了它，冲它展开攻击，</seg>
<seg id="666">but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his pursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was open and free of trees.</seg>
<seg id="666">接着拼命地追赶它。雄鹿很快领先于狮子，只要在没有树的旷野，它就一直跑在前面。</seg>
<seg id="667">But coming presently to a wood, he was caught by his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and claws of his enemy.</seg>
<seg id="667">但不久，雄鹿进入了一片树林，鹿角被树枝夹住了，雄鹿落入敌人的爪牙，成了牺牲品。</seg>
<seg id="668">"Woe is me!" he cried with his last breath;</seg>
<seg id="668">“唉，我真不幸啊！”雄鹿喘着最后一口气悲叹道，</seg>
<seg id="669">"I despised my legs, which might have saved my life:</seg>
<seg id="669">“我瞧不起自己的腿，而腿可以救我的命；</seg>
<seg id="670">but I gloried in my horns, and they have proved my ruin."</seg>
<seg id="670">我以头上的鹿角为荣，而鹿角却要了我的命。”</seg>
<seg id="671">What is worth most is often valued least.</seg>
<seg id="671">最有价值的东西往往最不受重视。</seg>
<seg id="672">THE DOG AND THE SHADOW</seg>
<seg id="672">狗和影子</seg>
<seg id="673">A Dog was crossing a plank bridge over a stream with a piece of meat in his mouth, when he happened to see his own reflection in the water.</seg>
<seg id="673">一只狗叼着一块肉，从小河的木桥上经过，它瞧见了自己在水中的倒影。</seg>
<seg id="674">He thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big;</seg>
<seg id="674">它以为那是另一只狗，而那只狗叼着的肉比自己的大一倍，</seg>
<seg id="675">so he let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece.</seg>
<seg id="675">于是它扔了自己的那块肉，扑向水中的狗，去抢那块更大的肉。</seg>
<seg id="676">But, of course, all that happened was that he got neither;</seg>
<seg id="676">当然，它什么也没有得到，</seg>
<seg id="677">for one was only a shadow, and the other was carried away by the current.</seg>
<seg id="677">因为这只不过是水中的一个倒影，而原有的那块肉也被水流冲走了。</seg>
<seg id="678">MERCURY AND THE TRADESMEN</seg>
<seg id="678">墨丘利和商人</seg>
<seg id="679">When Jupiter was creating man, he told Mercury to make an infusion of lies, and to add a little of it to the other ingredients which went to the making of the Tradesmen.</seg>
<seg id="679">朱庇特在创造人类的时候，让墨丘利制作一种能诱人说谎的毒药，并给自己正在创造的商人身上都加一点儿这种毒药。</seg>
<seg id="680">Mercury did so, and introduced an equal amount into each in turn--the tallow-chandler, and the greengrocer, and the haberdasher, and all, till he came to the horse-dealer, who was last on the list, when, finding that he had a quantity of the infusion still left, he put it all into him.</seg>
<seg id="680">墨丘利依次把毒药平均地撒到每一类商人身上——牛油烛商人、蔬菜水果商、杂货商，等等。直至他最后来到马贩跟前，发现还剩许多药，就都撒给了马贩。</seg>
<seg id="681">This is why all Tradesmen lie more or less, but they none of them lie like a horse-dealer.</seg>
<seg id="681">这就是为什么所有的商人几乎都爱说谎，而马贩说起谎来无人能比。</seg>
<seg id="682">THE MICE AND THE WEASELS</seg>
<seg id="682">老鼠和黄鼠狼</seg>
<seg id="683">There was war between the Mice and the Weasels, in which the Mice always got the worst of it, numbers of them being killed and eaten by the Weasels.</seg>
<seg id="683">老鼠和黄鼠狼交战，老鼠每回都败下阵来，很多老鼠被黄鼠狼吃掉了。</seg>
<seg id="684">So they called a council of war, in which an old Mouse got up and said, "It's no wonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battles and direct our movements in the field."</seg>
<seg id="684">于是，老鼠们召开了一次会议，有一只年长的老鼠站出来说：“因为没有将领为我们布置战术，指挥我们的行动，难怪我们总是被打败。”</seg>
<seg id="685">Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest Mice to be their leaders, and these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw.</seg>
<seg id="685">在它的建议下，它们选出几只最大的老鼠作为自己的将领。为了与普通成员区别开来，只有将领才能戴着插有稻草做的大羽毛的头盔。</seg>
<seg id="686">They then led out the Mice to battle, confident of victory:</seg>
<seg id="686">而后，将领带领其他老鼠去应战，自信能获胜。</seg>
<seg id="687">but they were defeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to their holes.</seg>
<seg id="687">但是，它们像往常一样被打败了，老鼠们立刻惊慌失措地飞快跑回自己的洞里。</seg>
<seg id="688">All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders, who were so hampered by the badges of their rank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to their pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="688">除了将领以外，其他老鼠都毫不费劲地安全回到洞里，将领们则被显示它们身份的大头盔阻碍了行动，无法回到洞里，都轻易地成了黄鼠狼的俘虏。</seg>
<seg id="689">Greatness carries its own penalties.</seg>
<seg id="689">虚荣会给自己带来不利的后果。</seg>
<seg id="690">THE PEACOCK AND JUNO</seg>
<seg id="690">孔雀和朱诺</seg>
<seg id="691">The Peacock was greatly discontented because he had not a beautiful voice like the nightingale, and he went and complained to Juno about it.</seg>
<seg id="691">孔雀因为自己没有像夜莺一样有美妙的嗓音而极为不满，它去朱诺那儿对此进行抱怨。</seg>
<seg id="692">"The nightingale's song," said he, "is the envy of all the birds;</seg>
<seg id="692">孔雀说：“夜莺的歌声为百鸟所羡慕，</seg>
<seg id="693">but whenever I utter a sound I become a laughing-stock."</seg>
<seg id="693">而每当我一出声，就成了它们的笑柄。”</seg>
<seg id="694">The goddess tried to console him by saying, "You have not, it is true, the power of song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty:</seg>
<seg id="694">女神朱诺试着安慰孔雀：“的确，你没有美妙的嗓音，但你在美貌上远远胜过其他鸟儿，</seg>
<seg id="695">your neck flashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of gorgeous colour."</seg>
<seg id="695">你的脖颈上闪耀着像绿宝石一样的羽毛，你的尾羽华美得令人惊叹。”</seg>
<seg id="696">But the Peacock was not appeased.</seg>
<seg id="696">然而，孔雀还是不满意。</seg>
<seg id="697">"What is the use," said he, "of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="697">它说：“像我这种无声的美丽有什么用呢？”</seg>
<seg id="698">Then Juno replied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, "Fate has allotted to all their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength, to the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree;</seg>
<seg id="698">朱诺以严肃的语气回答道：“命运赋予世间万物各有各的天资，赋予你以美丽，赋予老鹰以强壮，赋予夜莺以嗓音，其他鸟儿也有各自的优势，</seg>
<seg id="699">but you alone are dissatisfied with your portion.</seg>
<seg id="699">而你仅仅对自己的某些方面感到不满，</seg>
<seg id="700">Make, then, no more complaints.</seg>
<seg id="700">就不要再抱怨了。</seg>
<seg id="701">For, if your present wish were granted, you would quickly find cause for fresh discontent."</seg>
<seg id="701">因为，假如你现在的要求得到满足了，你很快会发现新的不满之处。”</seg>
<seg id="702">THE BEAR AND THE FOX</seg>

<seg id="703">A Bear was once bragging about his generous feelings, and saying how refined he was compared with other animals.</seg>
<seg id="703">从前，一只熊吹嘘自己有多么慷慨大度。它说，相比其他动物，自己是多么高尚。</seg>
<seg id="704">(There is, in fact, a tradition that a Bear will never touch a dead body.)</seg>
<seg id="704">（这指的是熊从来不碰死尸的习惯。）</seg>
<seg id="705">A Fox, who heard him talking in this strain, smiled and said, "My friend, when you are hungry, I only wish you would confine your attention to the dead and leave the living alone."</seg>
<seg id="705">一只狐狸听到了熊的语气如此高傲，笑着说：“朋友，当你饥饿的时候，我只希望你关注死了的动物，而放弃那些活着的生命。”</seg>

<seg id="708">一位老农夫坐在草地上，看着他那头正在吃草的驴。突然，老农夫看见一个持枪者正悄悄地靠近。</seg>
<seg id="709">He jumped up in a moment, and begged the Ass to fly with him as fast as he could,</seg>
<seg id="709">他立刻跳了起来，恳求驴带他尽快逃离。</seg>
<seg id="710">"Or else," said he, "we shall both be captured by the enemy."</seg>
<seg id="710">“否则，”他说，“我们都会被敌人逮住。”</seg>
<seg id="711">But the Ass just looked round lazily and said, "And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have to now?"</seg>
<seg id="711">而驴懒洋洋地朝周围看了看，说：“果真这样的话，你认为他们会让我驮运的货物比现在还要重吗？”</seg>
<seg id="712">"No," said his master.</seg>
<seg id="712">“不会的，”农夫说。</seg>
<seg id="713">"Oh, well, then," said the Ass, "I don't mind if they do take me, for I shan't be any worse off."</seg>

<seg id="720">Was he as big as this?" said the Frog, puffing herself out to look as big as possible.</seg>
<seg id="720">它有这么大吗？”青蛙妈妈说，它吸气鼓腹拼命把自己吹大。</seg>
<seg id="721">"Oh! yes, much bigger," was the answer.</seg>
<seg id="721">“噢，是的，非常大，”小青蛙回答道。</seg>

<seg id="842">群牛聚集在一起，讨论怎样有效地执行这个计划，它们磨尖牛角要决一死战。这时，一头老牛蹒跚着走过来说：“兄弟们，我知道你们有充分的理由去恨那些屠夫，但他们至少技艺娴熟，宰杀时没有给我们带来不必要的痛苦。</seg>
<seg id="843">But if we kill them, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by their bungling inflict great sufferings upon us.</seg>
<seg id="843">如果我们除掉了他们，其他没有经验的人也会来屠杀我们，他们笨手笨脚，会让我们遭受更大的痛苦。</seg>

<seg id="858">因此，狮子假惺惺地、不怀好意地暗中进行挑拨，引起三头公牛之间的互相嫉妒和怀疑。</seg>

<seg id="1009">When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: "I do not think," he said, "that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim;</seg>
<seg id="1009">猩猩听了双方的证词后，做出以下判断：“我认为，狼，你根本没有像你说的丢了东西。</seg>
<seg id="1010">but all the same I believe that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials."</seg>

<seg id="1022">过了一阵子，当寒鸦看上去已经变得相当温顺了，主人才放松对它的看管。寒鸦偷偷地溜了出去，飞回自己的老窝。</seg>

<seg id="1023">不幸的是，绳子仍然系在腿上。不久后，腿上的绳子在一棵树枝上缠住了，寒鸦尽力挣脱，然而却再也不能自由飞翔了。</seg>

<seg id="1040">乌鸦非常羡慕天鹅有着一身看上去美丽洁白的羽毛。它想，这是由于天鹅经常在水里洗澡和游泳。</seg>

<seg id="1041">于是，乌鸦离开以捡拾食物碎末为生的祭坛，搬到池塘和小溪边驻扎下来。</seg>

<seg id="1045">A Stag, blind of one eye, was grazing close to the sea-shore and kept his sound eye turned towards the land, so as to be able to perceive the approach of the hounds, while the blind eye he turned towards the sea, never suspecting that any danger would threaten him from that quarter.</seg>
<seg id="1045">有一头雄鹿，一只眼睛失明了。它在海边吃草时，就用视力好的那只眼睛盯着陆地，这样若有猎犬靠近时，它就能察觉得到；而那只失明的眼睛就对着大海，因为它从不觉得那个方向会有什么危险威胁到自己。</seg>

<seg id="1101">"If you spent the summer singing," replied the Ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing."</seg>

<seg id="1111">另一只生活在远处的一条水沟里，那里汇聚了雨后所有流过来的水。</seg>
<seg id="1112">The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there far more comfortable and--what was still more important--more safe.</seg>
<seg id="1112">生活在沼泽里的青蛙请自己的朋友过来和自己一起住，因为生活在沼泽里的青蛙发现水沟很不舒服，而且更重要的是，那里不安全。</seg>

<seg id="1113">但那只青蛙拒绝了，说自己不能从已经住惯了的地方搬走。</seg>
<seg id="1114">A few days afterwards a heavy waggon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the wheels.</seg>
<seg id="1114">几天以后，一辆很沉的马车翻倒在水沟里，那只青蛙被车轮压死了。</seg>
<seg id="1115">THE COBBLER TURNED DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1115">修鞋匠改行做医生</seg>
<seg id="1116">A very unskilful Cobbler, finding himself unable to make a living at his trade, gave up mending boots and took to doctoring instead.</seg>
<seg id="1116">有个非常笨拙的修鞋匠，发现自己靠做这一行无法度日，就放弃了修鞋，转而去行医。</seg>
<seg id="1117">He gave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all poisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for puffing himself.</seg>
<seg id="1117">他宣称自己有医治百病的秘方，通过吹嘘自己的才能博得了盛名。</seg>
<seg id="1118">One day, however, he fell very ill;</seg>
<seg id="1118">然而，有一天，他患了重病。</seg>
<seg id="1119">and the King of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy.</seg>
<seg id="1119">国王想要检验一下他的医术水平，</seg>
<seg id="1120">Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it.</seg>
<seg id="1120">叫人拿来一只杯子，往里面倒了一剂解药，谎称是在其中混了毒药，加了一点儿水，命令他喝下去。</seg>
<seg id="1121">Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the Cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="1121">修鞋匠担心中毒害怕极了，只好承认自己对医药常识一无所知，他的解药是毫无用处的。</seg>
<seg id="1122">Then the King summoned his subjects and addressed them as follows: "What folly could be greater than yours?</seg>
<seg id="1122">于是，国王召集臣民，对他们发表了下面的讲话：“还有什么能比你们更愚蠢呢？</seg>
<seg id="1123">Here is this Cobbler to whom no one will send his boots to be mended, and yet you have not hesitated to entrust him with your lives!"</seg>
<seg id="1123">这样一个没有人会把鞋拿去叫他修补的修鞋匠，你们竟毫不犹豫地把自己的生命托付给他！”</seg>
<seg id="1124">THE ASS, THE COCK, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1124">驴、公鸡和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1125">An Ass and a Cock were in a cattle-pen together.</seg>
<seg id="1125">一头驴和一只公鸡同在一个畜栏里。</seg>
<seg id="1126">Presently a Lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall upon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow.</seg>
<seg id="1126">这时，一头饿了好多天的狮子过来了，当它正要扑向驴，准备美餐一顿时，公鸡挺身而出奋力拍打翅膀，发出响亮的啼鸣。</seg>
<seg id="1127">Now, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of a Cock:</seg>
<seg id="1127">当时，如果有什么事能吓到狮子，那一定是公鸡的啼鸣，</seg>
<seg id="1128">and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled.</seg>
<seg id="1128">狮子一听到鸡叫，立刻逃跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1129">The Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion couldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an Ass:</seg>
<seg id="1129">驴瞧见这一情形，非常得意，心想，如果狮子连公鸡都不敢面对，那更别提见到驴子了。</seg>
<seg id="1130">so he ran out and pursued him.</seg>
<seg id="1130">于是，驴跑了出去，追赶狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1131">But when the two had got well out of sight and hearing of the Cock, the Lion suddenly turned upon the Ass and ate him up.</seg>
<seg id="1131">然而，当它们跑出公鸡的视线，也听不到鸡鸣时，狮子猛然转身扑过来，把驴给吃了。</seg>
<seg id="1132">False confidence often leads to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="1132">盲目自信常常会导致灾祸。</seg>
<seg id="1133">THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS</seg>
<seg id="1133">肚子和器官</seg>
<seg id="1134">The Members of the Body once rebelled against the Belly.</seg>
<seg id="1134">很早以前，身体上的各个器官一起反抗肚子。</seg>
<seg id="1135">"You," they said to the Belly, "live in luxury and sloth, and never do a stroke of work;</seg>
<seg id="1135">它们对肚子说：“你养尊处优，从来不干一点活，</seg>
<seg id="1136">while we not only have to do all the hard work there is to be done, but are actually your slaves and have to minister to all your wants.</seg>
<seg id="1136">而我们不仅要做所有辛苦的工作，而且像奴隶一样不得不满足你的一切需求。</seg>
<seg id="1137">Now, we will do so no longer, and you can shift for yourself for the future."</seg>
<seg id="1137">现在，我们不愿再这么做了，你要为自己的将来做改变了。”</seg>
<seg id="1138">They were as good as their word, and left the Belly to starve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">器官们说做就做，它们让肚子挨饿。</seg>
<seg id="1139">The result was just what might have been expected: the whole Body soon began to fail, and the Members and all shared in the general collapse.</seg>
<seg id="1139">结果可以想象：整个身体很快开始衰弱，所有的器官都整体衰退下来。</seg>
<seg id="1140">And then they saw too late how foolish they had been.</seg>
<seg id="1140">然而，当它们知道自己有多么愚蠢时，已为时太晚。</seg>
<seg id="1141">THE BALD MAN AND THE FLY</seg>
<seg id="1141">秃子和苍蝇</seg>
<seg id="1142">A Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him.</seg>
<seg id="1142">一只苍蝇停在秃子的头顶上，叮了他一口。</seg>
<seg id="1143">In his eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap.</seg>
<seg id="1143">秃子一心想要打死它，却给了自己狠狠一巴掌。</seg>
<seg id="1144">But the Fly escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me for just one little bite;</seg>
<seg id="1144">然而，苍蝇飞走了，并且还嘲笑秃子：“因为叮了你一小口，你就要灭我，</seg>
<seg id="1145">what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="1145">结果你给了自己狠狠的一掌，那你要怎么惩罚自己呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1146">"Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge," he replied, "for I never intended myself any harm;</seg>
<seg id="1146">“噢，对那一掌我无怨无悔，”秃子答道，“因为我从不故意伤害自己，</seg>
<seg id="1147">but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"</seg>
<seg id="1147">但你这只靠吸人血为生的卑鄙小虫，我已经忍受够了，只有灭了你才能让我满意。”</seg>
<seg id="1148">THE ASS AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1148">驴和狼</seg>
<seg id="1149">An Ass was feeding in a meadow, and, catching sight of his enemy the Wolf in the distance, pretended to be very lame and hobbled painfully along.</seg>
<seg id="1149">一头驴在草地上吃草，忽然看到远处有一只狼，驴假装有严重的跛脚，痛苦地蹒跚而行。</seg>
<seg id="1150">When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass how he came to be so lame, and the Ass replied that in going through a hedge he had trodden on a thorn, and he begged the Wolf to pull it out with his teeth,</seg>
<seg id="1150">狼走上前来，问驴怎么会这么跛。驴回答说，在穿越篱笆时踩到了一根荆棘。驴请求狼用牙齿把荆棘拔出来。</seg>
<seg id="1151">"In case," he said, "when you eat me, it should stick in your throat and hurt you very much."</seg>
<seg id="1151">它说：“免得你吃我时，这根荆棘刺入你的嗓子，让你非常痛苦。”</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Wolf said he would, and told the Ass to lift up his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="1152">狼说可以这么做，它让驴抬起脚，专心致志地去拔那根荆棘。</seg>
<seg id="1153">But the Ass suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the Wolf a fearful kick in the mouth, breaking his teeth;</seg>
<seg id="1153">然而，驴突然抬起蹄子踢向狼的嘴，打落了狼的牙齿，</seg>
<seg id="1154">and then he galloped off at full speed.</seg>
<seg id="1154">然后飞快地跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1155">As soon as he could speak the Wolf growled to himself, "It serves me right:</seg>
<seg id="1155">狼张开嘴，自言自语地说：“我真是活该！</seg>
<seg id="1156">my father taught me to kill, and I ought to have stuck to that trade instead of attempting to cure."</seg>
<seg id="1156">父亲教我残杀其他动物，我应该坚持这一谋生手段，而不是尝试去帮别人治疗。”</seg>
<seg id="1157">THE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL</seg>
<seg id="1157">猴子和骆驼</seg>
<seg id="1158">At a gathering of all the beasts the Monkey gave an exhibition of dancing and entertained the company vastly.</seg>
<seg id="1158">在百兽的聚会上，猴子表演的舞蹈深受大家喜欢。</seg>
<seg id="1159">There was great applause at the finish, which excited the envy of the Camel and made him desire to win the favour of the assembly by the same means.</seg>
<seg id="1159">谢幕时的热烈掌声引起了骆驼的羡慕，使得它也想通过同样的方式赢得大家的喜爱。</seg>
<seg id="1160">So he got up from his place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he plunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly person, that the beasts all fell upon him with ridicule and drove him away.</seg>
<seg id="1160">于是，骆驼从座位上站了起来，开始跳舞，但它的一举一动显得很可笑，它怪异滑稽的表演难看极了，野兽们都纷纷嘲笑骆驼，把它赶了出去。</seg>
<seg id="1161">THE SICK MAN AND THE DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1161">病人和医生</seg>
<seg id="1162">A Sick Man received a visit from his Doctor, who asked him how he was.</seg>
<seg id="1162">医生为病人看病，问他身体情况怎样。</seg>
<seg id="1163">"Fairly well, Doctor," said he, "but I find I sweat a great deal."</seg>
<seg id="1163">“很好，医生，”病人说，“但我感到出了很多汗。”</seg>
<seg id="1164">"Ah," said the Doctor, "that's a good sign."</seg>
<seg id="1164">“啊，”医生说，“那是好征兆。”</seg>
<seg id="1165">On his next visit he asked the same question, and his patient replied, "I'm much as usual, but I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all over."</seg>
<seg id="1165">在第二次看病时，医生又问了病人同样的问题，病人回答：“我像往常一样，但一直在打寒战，浑身发冷。”</seg>
<seg id="1166">"Ah," said the Doctor, "that's a good sign too."</seg>
<seg id="1166">“啊，”医生说，“那也是好征兆。”</seg>
<seg id="1167">When he came the third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the Sick Man said that he felt very feverish.</seg>
<seg id="1167">当医生第三次为病人看病，像以前一样询问病人的健康状况时，病人说感觉发高烧了。</seg>
<seg id="1168">"A very good sign," said the Doctor;</seg>
<seg id="1168">“那是很好的征兆，”医生说，</seg>
<seg id="1169">"you are doing very nicely indeed."</seg>
<seg id="1169">“你肯定感到非常愉快。”</seg>
<seg id="1170">Afterwards a friend came to see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply: "My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs."</seg>
<seg id="1170">后来，一位朋友来看病人，问他健康状况如何，病人回答：“亲爱的，我都快让好征兆给害死了。”</seg>
<seg id="1171">THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE</seg>
<seg id="1171">行人和悬铃树</seg>
<seg id="1172">Two Travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of a summer's day.</seg>
<seg id="1172">炎炎夏日，两个行人走在烈日当头、尘埃满天的路上。</seg>
<seg id="1173">Coming presently to a Plane-tree, they joyfully turned aside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of its spreading branches.</seg>
<seg id="1173">前方有一棵悬铃树，他俩高兴地走过去，在茂密的浓荫下躲避炙热的阳光。</seg>
<seg id="1174">As they rested, looking up into the tree, one of them remarked to his companion, "What a useless tree the Plane is!</seg>
<seg id="1174">他俩休息时，抬头看着树，其中一人对同伴说：“这种悬铃树多没用啊！</seg>
<seg id="1175">It bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all."</seg>
<seg id="1175">它不能结果实，对人类毫无用处。”</seg>
<seg id="1176">The Plane-tree interrupted him with indignation.</seg>
<seg id="1176">悬铃树气愤地喝止了他。</seg>
<seg id="1177">"You ungrateful creature!" it cried:</seg>
<seg id="1177">“你这个忘恩负义的家伙！”悬铃树吼道，</seg>
<seg id="1178">"you come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then, in the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me and call me good for nothing!"</seg>
<seg id="1178">“你到我这树下来躲避炙热的阳光，而且还尽情享受树叶带来的阴凉，你竟敢还侮辱我，说我没有一点儿用处！”</seg>
<seg id="1179">Many a service is met with ingratitude.</seg>
<seg id="1179">有助于人却遭忘恩负义。</seg>
<seg id="1180">THE FLEA AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1180">跳蚤和牛</seg>
<seg id="1181">A Flea once said to an Ox, "How comes it that a big strong fellow like you is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them, while I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink my fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?"</seg>
<seg id="1181">有一次，跳蚤对牛说：“像你这么高大强壮的家伙怎么会愿意为人类服务，为他们尽心尽力辛勤劳作？而我看起来比你小多了，却寄生在人的身上，尽情地吮吸他们的鲜血？”</seg>
<seg id="1182">To which the Ox replied, "Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to them:</seg>
<seg id="1182">牛对此回答道：“人类对我非常好，我很感激他们，</seg>
<seg id="1183">they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show their fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck."</seg>
<seg id="1183">他们给我吃好的、住好的，还经常轻轻地拍拍我的额头和脖子，表示对我的喜爱。”</seg>
<seg id="1184">"They'd pat me, too," said the Flea, "if I let them:</seg>
<seg id="1184">“他们也会拍我，”跳蚤说，“如果我让他们拍的话，</seg>
<seg id="1185">but I take good care they don't, or there would be nothing left of me."</seg>
<seg id="1185">我要非常小心，否则就被他们拍死了。”</seg>
<seg id="1186">THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT</seg>
<seg id="1186">鸟、兽和蝙蝠</seg>
<seg id="1187">The Birds were at war with the Beasts, and many battles were fought with varying success on either side.</seg>
<seg id="1187">鸟类和兽类交战，很多场战斗打下来各有胜负。</seg>
<seg id="1188">The Bat did not throw in his lot definitely with either party, but when things went well for the Birds he was found fighting in their ranks;</seg>
<seg id="1188">蝙蝠不确定自己该加入哪一方，当局势对鸟类有利时，蝙蝠就投向鸟类的阵营；</seg>
<seg id="1189">when, on the other hand, the Beasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the Beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1189">而当兽类在战斗中占上风时，蝙蝠就加入到兽类中。</seg>
<seg id="1190">No one paid any attention to him while the war lasted:</seg>
<seg id="1190">整个战争期间，没有任何一个动物注意到蝙蝠。</seg>
<seg id="1191">but when it was over, and peace was restored, neither the Birds nor the Beasts would have anything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to this day a solitary outcast from both.</seg>
<seg id="1191">而当战争结束，双方重建和平，鸟和兽都不愿与这样一个双面叛徒有任何关系。因此，蝙蝠直到今天仍然是一个被鸟兽摒弃的独居者。</seg>
<seg id="1192">THE MAN AND HIS TWO SWEETHEARTS</seg>
<seg id="1192">男子和他的两个情妇</seg>
<seg id="1193">A Man of middle age, whose hair was turning grey, had two Sweethearts, an old woman and a young one.</seg>
<seg id="1193">一个中年男子，头发开始渐渐花白了。他有两个情妇，一个半老徐娘、一个正值妙龄。</seg>
<seg id="1194">The elder of the two didn't like having a lover who looked so much younger than herself;</seg>
<seg id="1194">那个上了年纪的情妇不喜欢情人看上去比自己年轻许多，</seg>
<seg id="1195">so, whenever he came to see her, she used to pull the dark hairs out of his head to make him look old.</seg>
<seg id="1195">于是每当男子来看她，她都会把男子头上的黑发拔掉一些，使他看起来老一点。</seg>
<seg id="1196">The younger, on the other hand, didn't like him to look so much older than herself, and took every opportunity of pulling out the grey hairs, to make him look young.</seg>
<seg id="1196">另一个年轻的情妇，不喜欢男子看上去比自己老很多，每次一有机会就把他的白发拔掉，使他看起来更年轻。</seg>
<seg id="1197">Between them, they left not a hair in his head, and he became perfectly bald.</seg>
<seg id="1197">周旋于两个情妇之间，男子的头上留不下一根头发，彻底成了秃头。</seg>
<seg id="1198">THE EAGLE, THE JACKDAW, AND THE SHEPHERD</seg>
<seg id="1198">鹰、寒鸦和牧羊人</seg>
<seg id="1199">One day a Jackdaw saw an Eagle swoop down on a lamb and carry it off in its talons.</seg>
<seg id="1199">有一天，寒鸦看见一只鹰猛地扑向一只小羊，用爪子把小羊掠走了。</seg>
<seg id="1200">"My word," said the Jackdaw, "I'll do that myself."</seg>
<seg id="1200">“我的天哪，”寒鸦说，“我也要这么做。”</seg>
<seg id="1201">So it flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a great whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram.</seg>
<seg id="1201">于是，它高高地飞向空中，振翅冲到一只公羊的背上。</seg>
<seg id="1202">It had no sooner alighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it could do was of any use:</seg>
<seg id="1202">它一落到羊背上，爪子就被羊毛紧紧地缠住了，怎么用力也无法挣脱，</seg>
<seg id="1203">there it stuck, flapping away, and only making things worse instead of better.</seg>
<seg id="1203">寒鸦在那儿拍着翅膀不能动弹，只是越用力，情况比之前越糟。</seg>
<seg id="1204">By and by up came the Shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="1204">过了一会儿，牧羊人来了。</seg>
<seg id="1205">"Oho," he said, "so that's what you'd be doing, is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1205">“哎哟，”牧羊人说，“这就是你一直在做的事呀？”</seg>
<seg id="1206">And he took the Jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his children.</seg>
<seg id="1206">接着，他抓起寒鸦，剪下翅膀，把它带回家给孩子们。</seg>
<seg id="1207">It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it.</seg>
<seg id="1207">寒鸦看起来好奇怪，孩子们都不知道它是什么鸟。</seg>
<seg id="1208">"What sort of bird is it, father?" they asked.</seg>
<seg id="1208">“父亲，它是哪类鸟？”孩子们问。</seg>
<seg id="1209">"It's a Jackdaw," he replied, "and nothing but a Jackdaw:</seg>
<seg id="1209">“它是一只寒鸦，”牧羊人回答说，“它不过是一只寒鸦而已，</seg>
<seg id="1210">but it wants to be taken for an Eagle."</seg>
<seg id="1210">却想让别人以为它是一只鹰。”</seg>
<seg id="1211">If you attempt what is beyond your power, your trouble will be wasted and you court not only misfortune but ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="1211">不自量力只会使努力白费，不仅会遭遇不幸，而且还招来嘲笑。</seg>
<seg id="1212">THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS</seg>
<seg id="1212">磨坊主、他的儿子和他们的驴</seg>
<seg id="1213">A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him.</seg>
<seg id="1213">磨坊主在儿子的陪同下，赶着他的驴去集市，希望为驴找一个买家。</seg>
<seg id="1214">On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, "Did you ever see such a pair of fools?</seg>
<seg id="1214">路上，他们遇到了一群姑娘，姑娘们一边笑一边大声说：“你们可曾见过这么愚蠢的一对父子？</seg>
<seg id="1215">To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!"</seg>
<seg id="1215">当他们可以骑驴时，却还要沿着漫天灰尘的路吃力地走！”</seg>
<seg id="1216">The Miller thought there was sense in what they said;</seg>
<seg id="1216">磨坊主对姑娘们的话深有感触，</seg>
<seg id="1217">so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side.</seg>
<seg id="1217">于是，他让儿子骑在驴上，自己在一旁跟着走。</seg>
<seg id="1218">Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, "You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot!</seg>
<seg id="1218">不一会儿，他们遇到了他的几个老年朋友，那些人向父子俩打了招呼，并说：“让儿子骑驴，而你自己在一旁吃力地走路，你会宠坏你的儿子的！</seg>
<seg id="1219">Make him walk, young lazybones!</seg>
<seg id="1219">让他走路，年轻的懒骨头！</seg>
<seg id="1220">It'll do him all the good in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1220">他该体验一下这世上的美德。”</seg>
<seg id="1221">The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind.</seg>
<seg id="1221">磨坊主听了老朋友的建议，和儿子换了位，自己骑在驴背上，而他的儿子在一旁吃力地走着。</seg>
<seg id="1222">They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, "What a selfish old man!</seg>
<seg id="1222">他们没走多远，突然遇到一群妇女和孩子。磨坊主听到那群人说：“一个多么自私的老头！</seg>
<seg id="1223">He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!"</seg>
<seg id="1223">他自己舒舒服服地骑着驴，而让他那可怜的小孩费力跟着走！”</seg>
<seg id="1224">So he made his Son get up behind him.</seg>
<seg id="1224">于是，他让儿子坐在他身后。</seg>
<seg id="1225">Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion.</seg>
<seg id="1225">一路往前走着，他们又遇到几位行人，行人问磨坊主他骑着的驴是他自己的还是租来的。</seg>
<seg id="1226">He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell.</seg>
<seg id="1226">他回答，驴是自己的，正要去集市把驴卖了。</seg>
<seg id="1227">"Good heavens!" said they, "with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him.</seg>
<seg id="1227">“天哪！”行人说，“当这个可怜的牲畜驮着你们到集市时，已经筋疲力尽了，没有人会看得上它。</seg>
<seg id="1228">Why, you'd do better to carry him!"</seg>
<seg id="1228">你们驮着它不是更好吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1229">"Anything to please you," said the old man, "we can but try."</seg>
<seg id="1229">“那就听你的，”磨坊主说，“我们试一试。”</seg>
<seg id="1230">So they got off, tied the Ass's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them.</seg>
<seg id="1230">于是，他们从驴背上下来，用绳子把驴的腿绑在一起，挂在一根杆子上。最后，磨坊主和儿子抬着驴子来到镇上。</seg>
<seg id="1231">This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father and Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics.</seg>
<seg id="1231">这成了一幅非常滑稽的景象，人们拥过来对此嘲笑讥讽，并开玩笑地说，他们是一对冷酷的父子，有些人甚至喊他们为疯子。</seg>
<seg id="1232">They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1232">当他们来到一座桥上时，驴被嘈杂的噪声和喧嚣的环境吓坏了，踢断了捆绑它的绳子，掉到水里淹死了。</seg>
<seg id="1233">Whereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.</seg>
<seg id="1233">倒霉的磨坊主又恼又羞，从小路逃回家去。他这才明白，努力去讨每个人的欢心，却一个人的欢心也讨不到，而且还失去了他的驴子。</seg>

<seg id="1234">雄鹿和葡萄藤</seg>
<seg id="1235">A Stag, pursued by the huntsmen, concealed himself under cover of a thick Vine.</seg>
<seg id="1235">一头被猎人追捕的雄鹿，躲藏在茂密的葡萄藤下。</seg>
<seg id="1236">They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place without being aware that he was anywhere near.</seg>
<seg id="1236">猎人们不见雄鹿的踪迹，路过它的藏身之处时，也没有察觉到它就在附近。</seg>
<seg id="1237">Supposing all danger to be over, he presently began to browse on the leaves of the Vine.</seg>
<seg id="1237">雄鹿以为一切危险都过去了，便开始吃起葡萄藤上的叶子，</seg>
<seg id="1238">The movement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of them, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a venture into the foliage.</seg>
<seg id="1238">这下引起了折返回来的猎人的注意，其中一人以为有什么动物藏在这里，就对着茂密的树丛乱射一箭。</seg>
<seg id="1239">The unlucky Stag was pierced to the heart, and, as he expired, he said, "I deserve my fate for my treachery in feeding upon the leaves of my protector."</seg>
<seg id="1239">倒霉的雄鹿被箭射穿心脏，临死时，它说：“这是我罪有应得，谁叫我背信弃义，葡萄藤的叶子保护了我，我却把它给吃了。”</seg>
<seg id="1240">Ingratitude sometimes brings its own punishment.</seg>
<seg id="1240">忘恩负义者自会受到惩罚。</seg>
<seg id="1241">THE LAMB CHASED BY A WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1241">被狼追捕的羔羊</seg>
<seg id="1242">A Wolf was chasing a Lamb, which took refuge in a temple.</seg>
<seg id="1242">狼追赶着一只羔羊，羔羊逃到一座神庙里躲了起来。</seg>
<seg id="1243">The Wolf urged it to come out of the precincts, and said, "If you don't, the priest is sure to catch you and offer you up in sacrifice on the altar."</seg>
<seg id="1243">狼竭力劝说羔羊出来：“如果你不出来，祭司一定会抓住你，把你放到供桌上去献祭。”</seg>
<seg id="1244">To which the Lamb replied, "Thanks, I think I'll stay where I am:</seg>
<seg id="1244">羔羊对此回答道：“谢谢你。我想，我要待在我待的地方，</seg>
<seg id="1245">I'd rather be sacrificed any day than be eaten up by a Wolf."</seg>

<seg id="1246">射手和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1247">An Archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and all the animals fled at the sight of him with the exception of the Lion, who stayed behind and challenged him to fight.</seg>
<seg id="1247">射手跑到山上张弓射击，除了狮子以外，所有的动物一看到他就逃跑了，狮子留下来向他挑战。</seg>
<seg id="1248">But he shot an arrow at the Lion and hit him, and said, "There, you see what my messenger can do:</seg>
<seg id="1248">他朝狮子射了一箭，正中目标，于是说：“你要明白，这只是我的警告，</seg>
<seg id="1249">just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself."</seg>
<seg id="1249">等着瞧，看我怎么对付你。”</seg>
<seg id="1250">The Lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1250">当狮子感到被箭射中的剧痛时，迅速拔腿就跑。</seg>
<seg id="1251">A fox, who had seen it all happen, said to the Lion, "Come, don't be a coward:</seg>
<seg id="1251">一只狐狸看到了这一情况，便对狮子说：“嗨，别做胆小鬼，</seg>
<seg id="1252">why don't you stay and show fight?"</seg>
<seg id="1252">你为什么不留下来表现一番斗志呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1253">But the Lion replied, "You won't get me to stay, not you:</seg>
<seg id="1253">然而，狮子却回答：“你不能说服我留下，</seg>
<seg id="1254">why, when he sends a messenger like that before him, he must himself be a terrible fellow to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1254">因为他一箭都射得那么厉害，这必定是一个很难对付的家伙。”</seg>
<seg id="1255">Give a wide berth to those who can do damage at a distance.</seg>

<seg id="1256">狼和母山羊</seg>
<seg id="1257">A Wolf caught sight of a Goat browsing above him on the scanty herbage that grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to get at her, tried to induce her to come lower down.</seg>
<seg id="1257">狼看见母山羊在陡峭的岩石顶上，吃着寥寥的几棵草，无法上去逮住它，就竭力劝它往下走。</seg>
<seg id="1258">"You are risking your life up there, madam, indeed you are," he called out:</seg>
<seg id="1258">“夫人，你在上面真有生命危险，”狼大声地说，</seg>
<seg id="1259">"pray take my advice and come down here, where you will find plenty of better food."</seg>
<seg id="1259">“听我的建议，到下面来吧，你会发现这里有许多更鲜嫩的草。”</seg>
<seg id="1260">The Goat turned a knowing eye upon him. "It's little you care whether I get good grass or bad," said she:</seg>
<seg id="1260">母山羊瞥了狼一眼，说：“你才不会关心我是不是能吃到新鲜或不新鲜的草，</seg>
<seg id="1261">"what you want is to eat me."</seg>
<seg id="1261">你想的是怎样才能吃到我。”</seg>
<seg id="1262">THE SICK STAG</seg>
<seg id="1262">生病的鹿</seg>
<seg id="1263">A Stag fell sick and lay in a clearing in the forest, too weak to move from the spot.</seg>
<seg id="1263">有一头鹿生病了，躺在林中的一块空地上，虚弱得动弹不得。</seg>
<seg id="1264">When the news of his illness spread, a number of the other beasts came to inquire after his health, and they one and all nibbled a little of the grass that grew round the invalid till at last there was not a blade within his reach.</seg>
<seg id="1264">它生病的消息传出去后，许多野兽前来慰问它的病情，趁此机会，野兽们个个都来啃一点儿长在病鹿周围的草。直到后来，在病鹿所能够得着的范围内，一片草叶都没有了。</seg>
<seg id="1265">In a few days he began to mend, but was still too feeble to get up and go in search of fodder;</seg>
<seg id="1265">过了些日子，病鹿开始康复，但仍没有力气起来去寻找食物。</seg>
<seg id="1266">and thus he perished miserably of hunger owing to the thoughtlessness of his friends.</seg>
<seg id="1266">由于朋友们的自私，它不幸饿死了。</seg>
<seg id="1267">THE ASS AND THE MULE</seg>
<seg id="1267">驴和骡</seg>
<seg id="1268">A certain man who had an Ass and a Mule loaded them both up one day and set out upon a journey.</seg>
<seg id="1268">有个人有一头驴和一头骡。一天，这两头牲口都驮着重物一起动身出门。</seg>
<seg id="1269">So long as the road was fairly level, the Ass got on very well:</seg>
<seg id="1269">只要道路平坦，驴就走得很轻松，</seg>
<seg id="1270">but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his last gasp.</seg>
<seg id="1270">但不久，它们来到了非常崎岖陡峭的山路上，驴累得差点倒下。</seg>
<seg id="1271">So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the Mule refused.</seg>
<seg id="1271">于是，驴恳求骡为自己分担一部分负重，但骡拒绝了。</seg>
<seg id="1272">At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed.</seg>
<seg id="1272">最后，驴因筋疲力尽绊了一跤，栽倒在陡峭的路上，死了。</seg>
<seg id="1273">The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's, and he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double load.</seg>
<seg id="1273">赶车人很失望，只好把驴负载的重物加到骡的身上，同时，他剥下驴皮盖在骡所负载的重物上面。</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, "I have only got what I deserved:</seg>
<seg id="1274">骡承载上附加的重量，痛苦地蹒跚而行，它自言自语道：“我这是自作自受啊，</seg>
<seg id="1275">if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain."</seg>
<seg id="1275">假如我起初愿意助驴一臂之力，现在就不会驮着它的东西，还驮着它的皮了。”</seg>
<seg id="1276">THE HEIFER AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1276">小牛和公牛</seg>
<seg id="1277">A Heifer went up to an Ox, who was straining hard at the plough, and sympathised with him in a rather patronising sort of way on the necessity of his having to work so hard.</seg>
<seg id="1277">公牛在田里辛苦劳作，小牛走到公牛跟前，以相当高傲的姿态，同情公牛不得不如此辛苦地劳作。</seg>
<seg id="1278">Not long afterwards there was a festival in the village and every one kept holiday:</seg>
<seg id="1278">不久后，村里迎来了节日，人人都在享受假期，</seg>
<seg id="1279">but, whereas the Ox was turned loose into the pasture, the Heifer was seized and led off to sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="1279">而公牛也到草地上去放松一下，小牛却被抓去准备献祭。</seg>
<seg id="1280">"Ah," said the Ox, with a grim smile, "I see now why you were allowed to have such an idle time:</seg>
<seg id="1280">“啊，”公牛见状嘲笑着说，“我现在明白你为什么可以这样游手好闲了，</seg>
<seg id="1281">it was because you were always intended for the altar."</seg>
<seg id="1281">因为你一直在为去祭坛而准备。”</seg>
<seg id="1282">THE KINGDOM OF THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1282">狮子的王国</seg>
<seg id="1283">When the Lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a King ought to be.</seg>
<seg id="1283">当狮子统治地球上的百兽时，它从不心狠手辣、冷酷残暴，而是像一个国王应有的那样温文尔雅。</seg>
<seg id="1284">During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and drew up a code of laws under which all were to live in perfect equality and harmony:</seg>
<seg id="1284">在狮子统治时期，它召集全体野兽，拟定了一份所有动物都要和平相处的法律章程，</seg>
<seg id="1285">the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the stag, the leopard and the kid, the dog and the hare, all should dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship.</seg>
<seg id="1285">其中包括狼和羊、虎和鹿、豹和小羊、狗和兔，所有的动物都要在和平友好的环境下一起居住。</seg>
<seg id="1286">The hare said, "Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place without fear by the side of the strong!"</seg>
<seg id="1286">兔子说：“噢！我多么渴望有这一天，在那里，弱者就不用害怕边上的强者了！”</seg>
<seg id="1287">THE ASS AND HIS DRIVER</seg>
<seg id="1287">驴和赶驴人</seg>
<seg id="1288">An Ass was being driven down a mountain road, and after jogging along for a while sensibly enough he suddenly quitted the track and rushed to the edge of a precipice.</seg>
<seg id="1288">驴被赶着走在山路上，慢步向前走了一会儿后，突然猛地停下步子，蹿到悬崖边上。</seg>
<seg id="1289">He was just about to leap over the edge when his Driver caught hold of his tail and did his best to pull him back:</seg>
<seg id="1289">就在驴快要跳入悬崖的时候，赶驴人一把揪住驴的尾巴，用力拉它回来。</seg>
<seg id="1290">but pull as he might he couldn't get the Ass to budge from the brink.</seg>
<seg id="1290">但是，任赶驴人怎么使劲地拉，仍然不能使驴从悬崖边移动半步。</seg>
<seg id="1291">At last he gave up, crying, "All right, then, get to the bottom your own way;</seg>
<seg id="1291">最后，赶驴人只好放手，他哭喊道：“那好吧，你就以自己的方式往下赶路吧，</seg>
<seg id="1292">but it's the way to sudden death, as you'll find out quick enough."</seg>
<seg id="1292">但是你很快就会发现，这是一条迅疾通往死亡的道路。”</seg>
<seg id="1293">THE LION AND THE HARE</seg>
<seg id="1293">狮子和野兔</seg>
<seg id="1294">A Lion found a Hare sleeping in her form, and was just going to devour her when he caught sight of a passing stag.</seg>
<seg id="1294">狮子发现一只野兔在洞穴里睡觉，正要走过去吃它时，忽然瞥见一头雄鹿从一旁经过。</seg>
<seg id="1295">Dropping the Hare, he at once made for the bigger game;</seg>
<seg id="1295">狮子立刻抛下野兔，去追捕更大的猎物。</seg>
<seg id="1296">but finding, after a long chase, that he could not overtake the stag, he abandoned the attempt and came back for the Hare.</seg>
<seg id="1296">但狮子却发现，追了很久，还是追不上雄鹿，只好放弃追赶，回过头来找野兔。</seg>
<seg id="1297">When he reached the spot, however, he found she was nowhere to be seen, and he had to go without his dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1297">然而，当狮子回到原来的地方，却发现野兔不见了，它的美餐化为了乌有。</seg>
<seg id="1298">"It serves me right," he said; "I should have been content with what I had got, instead of hankering after a better prize."</seg>
<seg id="1298">“我活该啊，”狮子说，“我应该满足于已经到手的东西，而不是去追赶一个更大的猎物。”</seg>
<seg id="1299">THE WOLVES AND THE DOGS</seg>
<seg id="1299">狼和狗</seg>
<seg id="1300">Once upon a time the Wolves said to the Dogs, "Why should we continue to be enemies any longer?</seg>
<seg id="1300">有一次，狼对狗儿们说：“我们为什么要继续为敌呢？</seg>
<seg id="1301">You are very like us in most ways:</seg>
<seg id="1301">我们在许多方面都非常相像，</seg>
<seg id="1302">the main difference between us is one of training only.</seg>
<seg id="1302">最大的区别在于，只有你们是受人训练的。</seg>
<seg id="1303">We live a life of freedom; but you are enslaved to mankind, who beat you, and put heavy collars round your necks, and compel you to keep watch over their flocks and herds for them, and, to crown all, they give you nothing but bones to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1303">我们过着自由自在的生活，而你们要做人类的奴隶，他们打你们，把沉重的项圈套在你们的脖子上，迫使你们为他们看管牛群羊群。尤其是，他们除了给你们吃一点骨头以外，其他什么也没有。</seg>
<seg id="1304">Don't put up with it any longer, but hand over the flocks to us, and we will all live on the fat of the land and feast together."</seg>
<seg id="1304">别再忍气吞声了，把羊群交给我们，我们将一起过着养尊处优、大吃大喝的生活。”</seg>
<seg id="1305">The Dogs allowed themselves to be persuaded by these words, and accompanied the Wolves into their den.</seg>
<seg id="1305">狗儿们被这些话给说服了，和狼群一起进入洞穴。</seg>
<seg id="1306">But no sooner were they well inside than the Wolves set upon them and tore them to pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1306">但是，它们一进入洞里，狼群就对它们展开了攻击，把它们撕成了碎块。</seg>
<seg id="1307">Traitors richly deserve their fate.</seg>
<seg id="1307">叛徒应受到严厉的惩罚。</seg>
<seg id="1308">THE BULL AND THE CALF</seg>
<seg id="1308">公牛和牛犊</seg>
<seg id="1309">A full-grown Bull was struggling to force his huge bulk through the narrow entrance to a cow-house where his stall was, when a young Calf came up and said to him, "If you'll step aside a moment, I'll show you the way to get through."</seg>
<seg id="1309">一头公牛使劲儿扭着庞大的身躯，穿过一条狭窄的通道，到牛棚里去。这时，一头小牛犊走过来对公牛说：“如果你能到边上待会儿，我就会告诉你如何通过那里。”</seg>
<seg id="1310">The Bull turned upon him an amused look. "I knew that way," said he, "before you were born."</seg>
<seg id="1310">公牛转过身去笑着看了看小牛犊，说：“在你出生之前，我就知道那个方法了。”</seg>
<seg id="1311">THE TREES AND THE AXE</seg>
<seg id="1311">树和斧子</seg>
<seg id="1312">A Woodman went into the forest and begged of the Trees the favour of a handle for his Axe.</seg>
<seg id="1312">伐木者来到森林里，请求树木给他一个做斧子的柄。</seg>
<seg id="1313">The principal Trees at once agreed to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash sapling, out of which he fashioned the handle he desired.</seg>
<seg id="1313">树王立即同意了这个合理的要求，毫不犹豫地给了他一棵白蜡树的幼苗，伐木者就用它做了一个自己想要的斧柄。</seg>
<seg id="1314">No sooner had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest Trees in the wood.</seg>
<seg id="1314">他一有了新斧柄就开始工作，砍伐了林中的珍贵树木。</seg>
<seg id="1315">When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift, they cried, "Alas! alas!</seg>
<seg id="1315">当树木们看见伐木者用自己给的礼物所干的事，都哭喊道：“哎呀！哎呀！</seg>
<seg id="1316">We are undone, but we are ourselves to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1316">我们快完蛋了，但这得怪自己。</seg>
<seg id="1317">The little we gave has cost us all:</seg>
<seg id="1317">我们给了他那棵小树苗，都得为此付出代价。</seg>
<seg id="1318">had we not sacrificed the rights of the ash, we might ourselves have stood for ages."</seg>

<seg id="1319">THE ASTRONOMER</seg>
<seg id="1319">天文学家</seg>
<seg id="1320">There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="1320">从前，有个天文学家，习惯在晚上出去观测星象。</seg>
<seg id="1321">One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well.</seg>
<seg id="1321">一天晚上，他步行去郊外的途中，全神贯注地望着星空，没有注意到脚下的路，结果掉进了一口枯井。</seg>
<seg id="1322">As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, "If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you've got."</seg>
<seg id="1322">他倒在井底呻吟着，有人从他上面路过，闻声来到井口，朝下一看，明白了事情的原委，说道：“如果你是想说，你正在专心致志地观测星空，甚至没有看清脚下的路要带你去哪儿，那在我看来，你完全是自作自受。”</seg>
<seg id="1323">THE LABOURER AND THE SNAKE</seg>

<seg id="1324">工人的小儿子被一条蛇咬死了。</seg>
<seg id="1325">The father was beside himself with grief, and in his anger against the Snake he caught up an axe and went and stood close to the Snake's hole, and watched for a chance of killing it.</seg>
<seg id="1325">工人悲伤不已，他怒气冲冲地拿起斧头来到蛇洞口，要伺机杀了那条蛇。</seg>
<seg id="1326">Presently the Snake came out, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off the tip of its tail before it wriggled in again.</seg>
<seg id="1326">不一会儿，蛇出洞了，工人瞄准目标，对它一击，但只砍下了蛇的尾巴，蛇又爬回了洞里。</seg>
<seg id="1327">He then tried to get it to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="1327">接着，工人试图再次引蛇出洞，假装想要和蛇言归于好。</seg>
<seg id="1328">But the Snake said, "I can never be your friend because of my lost tail, nor you mine because of your lost child."</seg>
<seg id="1328">但蛇说：“我永远不会成为你的朋友，因为我失去了尾巴。而你也不会是我的朋友，因为你失去了孩子。”</seg>

<seg id="1332">一天晚上，飞来一只蝙蝠，停在笼子的栅栏上，问笼中鸟为什么白天一声不吭，而只在晚上唱歌。</seg>
<seg id="1333">"I have a very good reason for doing so," said the Bird:</seg>
<seg id="1333">“我有充分的理由这么做的，”笼中鸟说，</seg>
<seg id="1334">"it was once when I was singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and set his nets for me and caught me.</seg>
<seg id="1334">“我曾经在白天唱歌，却因歌声招来了捕鸟人，他用网把我给逮住了。</seg>
<seg id="1335">Since then I have never sung except by night."</seg>
<seg id="1335">从那以后，除了晚上，我白天从不唱歌。”</seg>
<seg id="1336">But the Bat replied, "It is no use your doing that now when you are a prisoner:</seg>
<seg id="1336">但蝙蝠回答说：“当你成为俘虏后，你如今就不用这么做了。</seg>
<seg id="1337">if only you had done so before you were caught, you might still have been free."</seg>

<seg id="1341">他一到家，把它牵进马厩，和其他驴关在一起。</seg>
<seg id="1342">The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable.</seg>
<seg id="1342">这初来乍到者朝四周看看，立即来到马厩里最懒最贪的动物边上待着。</seg>
<seg id="1343">When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again.</seg>
<seg id="1343">买主看到这一情形，立刻给它套上缰绳，带它回去，把它又还给了原来的主人。</seg>
<seg id="1344">The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?"</seg>
<seg id="1344">原主人见它这么快就回来了，非常惊讶，问道：“你已经通过试用知道它是什么动物了吗？”</seg>

<seg id="1354">so he took out his pipe and began to play, while the Kid danced before him.</seg>
<seg id="1354">于是就拿出笛子开始吹奏，而小羊就在狼的面前跳起了舞。</seg>
<seg id="1355">Before many minutes were passed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to see what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="1355">过了几分钟，羊群的保护者听到音乐声，赶过来看到正在发生的一切。</seg>
<seg id="1356">They no sooner clapped eyes on the Wolf than they gave chase and drove him away.</seg>
<seg id="1356">他们一见到狼就展开追击，把狼赶跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1357">As he ran off, he turned and said to the Kid, "It's what I thoroughly deserve:</seg>
<seg id="1357">狼逃跑时，回头对小羊说：“我这完全是咎由自取，</seg>
<seg id="1358">my trade is the butcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you."</seg>
<seg id="1358">我干的是屠夫的行当，而不是吹笛来取悦你。”</seg>
<seg id="1359">THE DEBTOR AND HIS SOW</seg>
<seg id="1359">欠债者和母猪</seg>
<seg id="1360">A Man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his creditor;</seg>
<seg id="1360">有个雅典人欠了债，被债主催着还钱，</seg>
<seg id="1361">but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for delay.</seg>
<seg id="1361">可他当时根本无力偿还，于是请求延缓债期。</seg>
<seg id="1362">But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once.</seg>
<seg id="1362">但债主不肯通融，要求他必须立即还债。</seg>
<seg id="1363">Then the Debtor fetched a Sow--the only one he had--and took her to market to offer her for sale.</seg>
<seg id="1363">欠债者牵出他仅有的一头母猪，带到市场上去出售。</seg>
<seg id="1364">It happened that his creditor was there too.</seg>
<seg id="1364">碰巧他的债主也在市场上。</seg>
<seg id="1365">Presently a buyer came along and asked if the Sow produced good litters.</seg>
<seg id="1365">不一会儿，有个顾客走过来，问这头母猪是否会下优良品种的猪崽。</seg>
<seg id="1366">"Yes," said the Debtor, "very fine ones;</seg>
<seg id="1366">“当然，”欠债者说，“这头猪下的崽非常棒，</seg>
<seg id="1367">and the remarkable thing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the Panathenea."</seg>
<seg id="1367">更特别的是，它在丰收女神节会下母崽，在护城女神节会下公崽。”</seg>
<seg id="1368">(Festivals these were: and the Athenians always sacrifice a sow at one, and a boar at the other;</seg>
<seg id="1368">（当地的节日风俗是这样的：雅典人总是先献上一头母猪，在另一时候又献上一头公猪，</seg>
<seg id="1369">while at the Dionysia they sacrifice a kid.)</seg>
<seg id="1369">而在狂欢节，他们要献出一只小山羊。）</seg>
<seg id="1370">At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in, "Don't be surprised, sir;</seg>
<seg id="1370">当时，站在边上的债主打断了他的话，说：“先生，不要感到惊讶，</seg>
<seg id="1371">why, still better, at the Dionysia this Sow has kids!"</seg>
<seg id="1371">更厉害的是，这头母猪在狂欢节会下小山羊呢！”</seg>
<seg id="1372">THE BALD HUNTSMAN</seg>
<seg id="1372">秃头的猎人</seg>
<seg id="1373">A Man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day he went out hunting.</seg>
<seg id="1373">有个秃子，平时习惯戴一顶假发。有一天，他出去打猎。</seg>
<seg id="1374">It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he hadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it off, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="1374">当时吹起了很大的风，他还没有走远，一阵大风就把他的帽子和假发都吹走了。</seg>
<seg id="1375">But he quite entered into the joke, and said, "Ah, well! the hair that wig is made of didn't stick to the head on which it grew;</seg>
<seg id="1375">然而，他开玩笑地说：“啊！这假发不是从头上长出来的，</seg>
<seg id="1376">so it's no wonder it won't stick to mine."</seg>
<seg id="1376">难怪它不属于我。”</seg>
<seg id="1377">THE HERDSMAN AND THE LOST BULL</seg>
<seg id="1377">牧人和丢失的牛</seg>
<seg id="1378">A Herdsman was tending his cattle when he missed a young Bull, one of the finest of the herd.</seg>
<seg id="1378">牧人在放牛时丢失了牛群中最好的一头小牛。</seg>
<seg id="1379">He went at once to look for him, but, meeting with no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should discover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">他立刻到处寻找，但一无所获。他发誓，如果发现小偷，他就献出一头牛犊给朱庇特。</seg>
<seg id="1380">Continuing his search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion devouring the lost Bull.</seg>
<seg id="1380">牧人继续寻找，他进入灌木丛，突然看到一头狮子正在狼吞虎咽地吃丢失的那头小牛。</seg>
<seg id="1381">Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to heaven and cried, "Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf to thee if I should discover the thief:</seg>
<seg id="1381">他害怕极了，举起双手向天祈求道：“伟大的朱庇特，我刚才发誓如果发现小偷要献一头牛犊给你，</seg>
<seg id="1382">but now a full-grown Bull I promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches."</seg>
<seg id="1382">但现在只要我能从狮爪下安全逃脱，我保证给你一头成年的公牛。”</seg>
<seg id="1383">THE MULE</seg>
<seg id="1383">骡</seg>
<seg id="1384">One morning a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked about saying, "My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and I take after him entirely."</seg>
<seg id="1384">一天早上，骡吃得太饱了，无法干活。骡开始认为自己非常英俊，并欢蹦乱跳地说：“我的父亲无疑是一匹勇敢的骏马，我长得和它一模一样。”</seg>
<seg id="1385">But very soon afterwards he was put into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind him.</seg>
<seg id="1385">但不久后，骡被套上马具，被迫载着重物去远行。</seg>
<seg id="1386">At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, "I must have been mistaken about my father;</seg>
<seg id="1386">一天走下来，骡筋疲力尽，它垂头丧气地自言自语：“我肯定认错父亲了，</seg>
<seg id="1387">he can only have been an ass after all."</seg>
<seg id="1387">它毕竟只是一头驴。”</seg>
<seg id="1388">THE HOUND AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1388">猎狗和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1389">A Hound, roaming in the forest, spied a lion, and being well used to lesser game, gave chase, thinking he would make a fine quarry.</seg>
<seg id="1389">猎狗在森林里漫步，远远地发现一头狮子步履蹒跚，于是展开追捕，心想那是一个很好的目标。</seg>
<seg id="1390">Presently the lion perceived that he was being pursued;</seg>
<seg id="1390">不久，狮子感到自己正被追捕，</seg>
<seg id="1391">so, stopping short, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar.</seg>
<seg id="1391">就突然停下来，绕着猎狗转圈圈，并发出一声大吼。</seg>
<seg id="1392">The Hound immediately turned tail and fled.</seg>
<seg id="1392">猎狗立即掉头跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1393">A Fox, seeing him running away, jeered at him and said, "Ho! ho!</seg>
<seg id="1393">一只狐狸见猎狗逃跑，就嘲笑它，说：“呵呵！</seg>
<seg id="1394">There goes the coward who chased a lion and ran away the moment he roared!"</seg>
<seg id="1394">追捕狮子的胆小鬼，听到狮子吼了一声就立刻吓跑了！”</seg>
<seg id="1395">THE FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTERS</seg>
<seg id="1395">父亲和两个女儿</seg>
<seg id="1396">A Man had two Daughters, one of whom he gave in marriage to a gardener, and the other to a potter.</seg>
<seg id="1396">某人有两个女儿，一个嫁给了园丁，另一个嫁给了陶工。</seg>
<seg id="1397">After a time he thought he would go and see how they were getting on;</seg>
<seg id="1397">过了一段时间，他想去看看女儿们过得怎样。</seg>
<seg id="1398">and first he went to the gardener's wife.</seg>
<seg id="1398">他先去看了嫁给园丁的女儿，</seg>
<seg id="1399">He asked her how she was, and how things were going with herself and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1399">他问女儿过得如何，夫妻俩是否事事称心。</seg>
<seg id="1400">She replied that on the whole they were doing very well:</seg>
<seg id="1400">女儿回答说，总的情况非常好，</seg>
<seg id="1401">"But," she continued, "I do wish we could have some good heavy rain:</seg>
<seg id="1401">“但是，”她接着说，“我只希望老天能好好地下场雨，</seg>
<seg id="1402">the garden wants it badly."</seg>
<seg id="1402">花园非常需要雨水的灌溉。”</seg>
<seg id="1403">Then he went on to the potter's wife and made the same inquiries of her.</seg>
<seg id="1403">然后，这人又去看望嫁给陶工的女儿，并问了同样的问题。</seg>
<seg id="1404">She replied that she and her husband had nothing to complain of:</seg>
<seg id="1404">这个女儿回答说，他们夫妻俩没什么不满的，</seg>
<seg id="1405">"But," she went on, "I do wish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery."</seg>
<seg id="1405">“但是，”她接着说，“我只希望能有晴朗干爽的好天气，能把陶器晾干。”</seg>
<seg id="1406">Her Father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face.</seg>
<seg id="1406">父亲面带笑意看着她，</seg>
<seg id="1407">"You want dry weather," he said, "and your sister wants rain.</seg>
<seg id="1407">“你希望干爽的天气，你姐姐盼望雨天。</seg>
<seg id="1408">I was going to ask in my prayers that your wishes should be granted;</seg>
<seg id="1408">我会为你们祈愿，希望你们的愿望都能实现，</seg>
<seg id="1409">but now it strikes me I had better not refer to the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1409">而现在最好什么也别说了。”</seg>
<seg id="1410">THE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS</seg>
<seg id="1410">家驴和野驴</seg>
<seg id="1411">A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself.</seg>
<seg id="1411">有一天，悠闲逍遥的野驴遇到一头躺在阳光下、舒展着四肢、正在享受生活的家驴。</seg>
<seg id="1412">Going up to him, he said, "What a lucky beast you are!</seg>
<seg id="1412">野驴走到家驴面前，对它说：“你真是个幸运的家伙！</seg>
<seg id="1413">Your sleek coat shows how well you live:</seg>
<seg id="1413">你那柔滑光亮的皮毛表明你生活得很好，</seg>
<seg id="1414">how I envy you!"</seg>
<seg id="1414">我好羡慕你啊！”</seg>
<seg id="1415">Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick.</seg>
<seg id="1415">不久后，野驴又遇见家驴，但这回，家驴驮运着重物，赶驴人在后面用粗棍鞭打它。</seg>
<seg id="1416">"Ah, my friend," said the Wild Ass, "I don't envy you any more:</seg>
<seg id="1416">“噢，我的朋友，”野驴说，“我不再羡慕你了，</seg>
<seg id="1417">for I see you pay dear for your comforts."</seg>
<seg id="1417">因为我瞧见你为了舒适所付出的昂贵的代价。”</seg>
<seg id="1418">Advantages that are dearly bought are doubtful blessings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">花很大的代价得来的好处不一定是福气。</seg>
<seg id="1419">THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS</seg>
<seg id="1419">驴和主人</seg>
<seg id="1420">A Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating.</seg>
<seg id="1420">花匠养了一头驴，驴几乎没什么食物可吃，还要驮运沉重的货物，而且经常挨打，日子过得很不好。</seg>
<seg id="1421">The Ass therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over to another master.</seg>
<seg id="1421">驴因此央求朱庇特带它离开花匠，把它交给别的主人。</seg>
<seg id="1422">So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid him sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did.</seg>
<seg id="1422">于是，朱庇特派墨丘利去找花匠，命令他把驴卖给一个陶匠。</seg>
<seg id="1423">But the Ass was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before:</seg>
<seg id="1423">但是驴并不满意，因为它现在得比之前更辛苦地工作，</seg>
<seg id="1424">so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a Tanner.</seg>
<seg id="1424">于是它再次请求朱庇特让它逃离这种生活。朱庇特很热心地安排把它卖给一位制革匠。</seg>
<seg id="1425">But when the Ass saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, "Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated?</seg>
<seg id="1425">但是当驴子得知新主人的职业时，它绝望地喊道：“我怎么会对以前的那些主人不满呢？虽然我要辛苦地工作，他们对我也不好，</seg>
<seg id="1426">for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat."</seg>
<seg id="1426">但至少我死了他们会好好地埋葬我。而现在，我死后，连我的皮都会被拿去制成皮桶了。”</seg>
<seg id="1427">Servants don't know a good master till they have served a worse.</seg>
<seg id="1427">仆人只有在遇到更糟的主人后，才明白前主人的好。</seg>
<seg id="1428">THE PACK-ASS, THE WILD ASS, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1428">驮货驴、野驴和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1429">A Wild Ass saw a Pack-Ass jogging along under a heavy load, and taunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these words: "What a vile lot is yours compared with mine!</seg>
<seg id="1429">野驴看见驮货驴背着一袋重物正在慢慢地走，就开口嘲笑它活得像奴隶一样：“和我相比，你的命运太可悲了！</seg>
<seg id="1430">I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work;</seg>
<seg id="1430">我像空气一样自由自在，从来不用干一点儿活，</seg>
<seg id="1431">and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs.</seg>
<seg id="1431">想吃草只要到山坡上去，那儿的草足够我吃的了。</seg>
<seg id="1432">But you!</seg>
<seg id="1432">而你！</seg>
<seg id="1433">you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully."</seg>
<seg id="1433">你得靠主人提供食物，他让你每天运沉重的货物，还残酷地鞭打你。”</seg>
<seg id="1434">At that moment a Lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass owing to the presence of the driver;</seg>
<seg id="1434">就在那时，一头狮子出现了，由于赶驴人在那儿，狮子无意去侵犯驮货驴，</seg>
<seg id="1435">but he fell upon the Wild Ass, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.</seg>
<seg id="1435">而冲向无人保护的野驴，毫不费力地把它吃了。</seg>
<seg id="1436">It is no use being your own master unless you can stand up for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1436">除非你能保护自己，否则做自己的主人毫无用处。</seg>
<seg id="1437">THE ANT</seg>
<seg id="1437">蚂蚁</seg>
<seg id="1438">Ants were once men and made their living by tilling the soil.</seg>
<seg id="1438">从前，蚂蚁本是人类，以耕地为生。</seg>
<seg id="1439">But, not content with the results of their own work, they were always casting longing eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they stole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store.</seg>
<seg id="1439">然而，它们不满足于自己的工作成果，总把眼睛盯着邻居们的谷物和果实，只要一有机会，就偷邻居的东西，增加自己的储存。</seg>
<seg id="1440">At last their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into Ants.</seg>
<seg id="1440">终于，它们的贪婪令朱庇特非常恼怒，就把它们都变成了蚂蚁。</seg>
<seg id="1441">But, though their forms were changed, their nature remained the same:</seg>
<seg id="1441">然而，虽然它们的外形变了，它们的本性仍然和以前一样。</seg>
<seg id="1442">and so, to this day, they go about among the cornfields and gather the fruits of others' labour, and store them up for their own use.</seg>
<seg id="1442">所以，直到今天，蚂蚁还是会到田里去，搬走别人的劳动果实，存储起来为自己所用。</seg>
<seg id="1443">You may punish a thief, but his bent remains.</seg>
<seg id="1443">你可以惩罚一个小偷，但他的本性难移。</seg>
<seg id="1444">THE FROGS AND THE WELL</seg>
<seg id="1444">青蛙和井</seg>
<seg id="1445">Two Frogs lived together in a marsh.</seg>
<seg id="1445">两只青蛙共同生活在一片沼泽里。</seg>
<seg id="1446">But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them.</seg>
<seg id="1446">但有一年夏天，沼泽干涸了，由于青蛙喜好潮湿的地方，它们便离开那里，去寻找其他的住所。</seg>
<seg id="1447">By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, "This looks a nice cool place:</seg>
<seg id="1447">不久，它们来到一口深井旁，其中一只青蛙朝井下看了看，对另一只青蛙说：“这儿看起来是一处非常凉爽的地方，</seg>
<seg id="1448">let us jump in and settle here."</seg>
<seg id="1448">我们就跳下去在这里安家吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1449">But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, "Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?"</seg>
<seg id="1449">但另一只头脑聪明的青蛙回答说：“朋友，别这么着急，假如这口井像沼泽一样干涸了，我们怎么出来呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1450">Think twice before you act.</seg>
<seg id="1450">三思而后行。</seg>
<seg id="1451">THE CRAB AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1451">螃蟹和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1452">A Crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some way inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a good place to feed in.</seg>
<seg id="1452">一只螃蟹离开海滩，去了陆地上的一块草场住了下来，那里看上去非常不错，长满了青青的草，像是一个有着肥沃饲料的好地方。</seg>
<seg id="1453">But a hungry Fox came along and spied the Crab and caught him.</seg>
<seg id="1453">然而，一只饥饿的狐狸出现了，看见螃蟹，就逮住了它。</seg>
<seg id="1454">Just as he was going to be eaten up, the Crab said, "This is just what I deserve;</seg>
<seg id="1454">当狐狸要把螃蟹吃了的时候，螃蟹说：“我真是咎由自取啊，</seg>
<seg id="1455">for I had no business to leave my natural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the land."</seg>
<seg id="1455">因为我没理由离开海边的天然栖息地搬到这里，还当自己是属于陆地似的。”</seg>
<seg id="1456">Be content with your lot.</seg>
<seg id="1456">知足常乐。</seg>
<seg id="1457">THE FOX AND THE GRASSHOPPER</seg>
<seg id="1457">狐狸和蚱蜢</seg>
<seg id="1458">A Grasshopper sat chirping in the branches of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1458">一只蚱蜢在树枝间鸣叫。</seg>
<seg id="1459">A Fox heard her, and, thinking what a dainty morsel she would make, he tried to get her down by a trick.</seg>
<seg id="1459">狐狸听到了它的叫声，心想，这只蚱蜢可以成为我的一顿美味佳肴。狐狸试着耍个花招让蚱蜢从树枝上下来。</seg>
<seg id="1460">Standing below in full view of her, he praised her song in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying he would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a voice.</seg>
<seg id="1460">狐狸站在蚱蜢的视线下，用谄媚的词句来赞美蚱蜢的歌声，请求它下来，说自己非常希望结识有着如此美妙嗓音的朋友。</seg>
<seg id="1461">But she was not to be taken in, and replied, "You are very much mistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down:</seg>
<seg id="1461">但蚱蜢没有上当，它回答说：“亲爱的先生，你大错特错了，假如你想要我下来，</seg>
<seg id="1462">I keep well out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw numbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's earth."</seg>
<seg id="1462">我要为自己留一条好的出路，因为自从我看到许多蚱蜢的翅膀散落在狐狸窝入口处的那天起，我就知道了你的本性。”</seg>
<seg id="1463">THE ASS AND THE DOG</seg>
<seg id="1463">驴和狗</seg>
<seg id="1464">An Ass and a Dog were on their travels together, and, as they went along, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1464">驴和狗一同出行，它们走着走着，看到地上有一封密封的信件。</seg>
<seg id="1465">The Ass picked it up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he proceeded to read out aloud to the Dog.</seg>
<seg id="1465">驴拾起来，拆开封印，发现信上写着一些话，它大声地读给狗听。</seg>
<seg id="1466">As he read on it turned out to be all about grass and barley and hay--in short, all the kinds of fodder that Asses are fond of.</seg>
<seg id="1466">结果，信上提到的都是关于牧草、大麦和干草——总之，都是驴所喜欢的那些饲料。</seg>
<seg id="1467">The Dog was a good deal bored with listening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of him, and he cried, "Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there isn't something about meat and bones."</seg>
<seg id="1467">狗听到都是这些东西，觉得很烦，到最后，它急得大喊：“朋友，快跳过这几页吧，看看后面有没有提到肉和骨头。”</seg>
<seg id="1468">The Ass glanced all through the packet, but found nothing of the sort, and said so.</seg>
<seg id="1468">驴将这封信通篇扫了一眼，发现一点没提到狗所说的那些东西。</seg>
<seg id="1469">Then the Dog said in disgust, "Oh, throw it away, do: what's the good of a thing like that?"</seg>
<seg id="1469">于是，狗厌恶地说：“噢，快把它扔了吧，这种信会有什么好事儿呀？”</seg>
<seg id="1470">THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE</seg>
<seg id="1470">驮运神像的驴</seg>
<seg id="1471">A certain man put an Image on the back of his Ass to take it to one of the temples of the town.</seg>
<seg id="1471">有个人把一尊神像放到驴背上，让它运到城里的一座庙里去。</seg>
<seg id="1472">As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the Image;</seg>
<seg id="1472">一路上，他们遇到的所有人都脱帽弯腰向神像致礼，</seg>
<seg id="1473">but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1473">驴却以为人们这么做，是出于对它的尊敬，因此开始趾高气扬起来。</seg>
<seg id="1474">At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further.</seg>
<seg id="1474">最后，驴变得非常自负，以为自己能为所欲为，并且为了抗议让自己驮运这么重的货物，完全停了下来，不愿再多走一步。</seg>
<seg id="1475">His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, "Oh, you dunder-headed idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass?"</seg>
<seg id="1475">赶驴人见它如此顽固，用棍子不断狠狠地打它，边打边说：“噢，你这个蠢货，你以为人们向一头驴膜拜的时代已经到来了吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1476">Rude shocks await those who take to themselves the credit that is due to others.</seg>
<seg id="1476">一棒敲醒那些把属于别人的荣誉归功于自己的人。</seg>
<seg id="1477">THE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT</seg>
<seg id="1477">牧羊人和山羊</seg>
<seg id="1478">A Goatherd was one day gathering his flock to return to the fold, when one of his goats strayed and refused to join the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1478">一天，牧羊人赶着羊群回羊栏，其中有一只山羊离群了，不愿和其他羊一起去休息。</seg>
<seg id="1479">He tried for a long time to get her to return by calling and whistling to her, but the Goat took no notice of him at all;</seg>
<seg id="1479">牧羊人叫唤它、对它吹口哨，花了很长时间，想方设法想让它回去，但这头山羊对牧羊人毫不理睬。</seg>
<seg id="1480">so at last he threw a stone at her and broke one of her horns.</seg>
<seg id="1480">牧羊人最后只好朝它扔了一块石头，打破它一只羊角。</seg>
<seg id="1481">In dismay, he begged her not to tell his master: but she replied, "You silly fellow, my horn would cry aloud even if I held my tongue."</seg>
<seg id="1481">牧羊人为此惊惶失措，他请求山羊不要告诉他的主人，然而山羊回答：“你这蠢家伙，即使我不出声，我的角也会大声地说出来。”</seg>
<seg id="1482">It's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1482">欲盖弥彰。</seg>
<seg id="1483">THE SHEPHERD AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1483">牧羊人和狼</seg>
<seg id="1484">A Shepherd found a Wolf's Cub straying in the pastures, and took him home and reared him along with his dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1484">牧羊人在草地上发现了一只迷路的狼崽子，就把它带回家，和他的牧羊犬养在一起。</seg>
<seg id="1485">When the Cub grew to his full size, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the dogs in hunting him down.</seg>
<seg id="1485">狼崽子长大了，如果有狼从羊群中偷走一只羊，它常常会加入牧羊犬的队伍，去追捕那匹狼。</seg>
<seg id="1486">It sometimes happened that the dogs failed to come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home.</seg>
<seg id="1486">有时，牧羊犬追不上偷羊的狼，就放弃追捕回家了。</seg>
<seg id="1487">The Wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and when he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him, and then return to the Shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="1487">小狼在这种情况下会继续独自追捕，当它追到那个罪犯，就停下来和它们一起享用美餐，然后再回到牧羊人那里。</seg>
<seg id="1488">But if some time passed without a sheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself and share his plunder with the dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1488">但如果有时一只羊也没有被狼抓走，小狼就会自己偷一只羊，和牧羊犬一起分享。</seg>
<seg id="1489">The Shepherd's suspicions were aroused, and one day he caught him in the act;</seg>
<seg id="1489">牧羊人起了疑心，有一天，当场抓住了正在偷羊的小狼，</seg>
<seg id="1490">and, fastening a rope round his neck, hung him on the nearest tree.</seg>
<seg id="1490">于是在小狼的脖颈上套上一根粗绳，在附近的树上把它吊死了。</seg>
<seg id="1491">What's bred in the bone is sure to come out in the flesh.</seg>
<seg id="1491">江山易改，本性难移。</seg>
<seg id="1492">THE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT</seg>
<seg id="1492">狮子、朱庇特和大象</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Lion, for all his size and strength, and his sharp teeth and claws, is a coward in one thing:</seg>
<seg id="1493">狮子尽管高大英武、身强力壮，而且还有着锋利的爪牙，但却因一件事认为自己是一个懦夫。</seg>
<seg id="1494">he can't bear the sound of a cock crowing, and runs away whenever he hears it.</seg>
<seg id="1494">那就是，它不能忍受公鸡的啼叫，每次听到这个声音，它就逃得远远的。</seg>
<seg id="1495">He complained bitterly to Jupiter for making him like that;</seg>
<seg id="1495">狮子伤心地埋怨朱庇特把自己弄成这个样子。</seg>
<seg id="1496">but Jupiter said it wasn't his fault:</seg>
<seg id="1496">但朱庇特说，这不是自己的错，</seg>
<seg id="1497">he had done the best he could for him, and, considering this was his only failing, he ought to be well content.</seg>
<seg id="1497">已经尽力把它做成最好的了，正因如此，狮子只有一个弱点，它应该非常满意了。</seg>
<seg id="1498">The Lion, however, wouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he wished he might die.</seg>
<seg id="1498">可是，狮子还是不舒服，它因为自己的胆怯而倍感羞愧，恨不得就这样死去。</seg>
<seg id="1499">In this state of mind, he met the Elephant and had a talk with him.</seg>
<seg id="1499">在这样的精神状态下，狮子遇见了大象，它们聊了起来。</seg>
<seg id="1500">He noticed that the great beast cocked up his ears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked him why he did so.</seg>
<seg id="1500">狮子注意到，大象一直都竖着耳朵，似乎在倾听什么，就问大象为什么这样。</seg>
<seg id="1501">Just then a gnat came humming by, and the Elephant said, "Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect?</seg>
<seg id="1501">正在这时，一只蚊子嗡嗡地飞过来，大象说：“你瞧见那只讨厌的小虫子了吗？</seg>
<seg id="1502">I'm terribly afraid of its getting into my ear:</seg>
<seg id="1502">我很怕它钻到我的耳朵里来，</seg>
<seg id="1503">if it once gets in, I'm dead and done for."</seg>
<seg id="1503">如果它钻了进来，我就会因此而死。”</seg>
<seg id="1504">The Lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: "For," he said to himself, "if the Elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a gnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is ten thousand times bigger than a gnat."</seg>
<seg id="1504">狮子听到这话立即打起精神，自言自语地说：“如果像大象这样的庞然大物都害怕一只蚊子，我不必为害怕一只公鸡而羞愧难当，公鸡要比蚊子大一万倍呢。”</seg>
<seg id="1505">THE PIG AND THE SHEEP</seg>
<seg id="1505">猪和羊</seg>
<seg id="1506">A Pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of Sheep were grazing.</seg>
<seg id="1506">一头猪发现自己闯进了羊群正在吃草的牧场。</seg>
<seg id="1507">The shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the butcher's when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free.</seg>
<seg id="1507">牧羊人逮住猪，打算把它带到屠夫那儿去。猪大声地号叫，奋力挣扎。</seg>
<seg id="1508">The Sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, "The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we don't make any fuss."</seg>
<seg id="1508">羊怪它发出这么大的叫声，对它说：“牧羊人经常抓我们，就像那样把我们拖走，我们一点儿不紧张。”</seg>
<seg id="1509">"No, I dare say not," replied the Pig, "but my case and yours are altogether different:</seg>
<seg id="1509">“我可不敢苟同，”猪回答，“我的情况和你们的完全不同，</seg>
<seg id="1510">he only wants you for wool, but he wants me for bacon."</seg>
<seg id="1510">牧羊人要的只是你的毛，却是要我的命。”</seg>
<seg id="1511">THE GARDENER AND HIS DOG</seg>
<seg id="1511">园丁和狗</seg>
<seg id="1512">A Gardner's Dog fell into a deep well, from which his master used to draw water for the plants in his garden with a rope and a bucket.</seg>
<seg id="1512">园丁的狗掉入一口深井里，过去园丁经常用绳子吊着水桶从这里汲水来浇灌园子里的植物。</seg>
<seg id="1513">Failing to get the Dog out by means of these, the Gardener went down into the well himself in order to fetch him up.</seg>
<seg id="1513">园丁用了许多方法都不能把狗救出来。为了把狗救上来，园丁亲自来到井下。</seg>
<seg id="1514">But the Dog thought he had come to make sure of drowning him;</seg>
<seg id="1514">而狗却以为，园丁下井是要把它溺死，</seg>
<seg id="1515">so he bit his master as soon as he came within reach, and hurt him a good deal, with the result that he left the Dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking, "It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1515">因此园丁一到井里，狗就咬了他一口。园丁伤得很重，这使得他不再管狗的死活而爬出井外，说道：“为了去救这个决意要找死的家伙，我真是活该啊。”</seg>
<seg id="1516">THE RIVERS AND THE SEA</seg>
<seg id="1516">河流和海洋</seg>
<seg id="1517">Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt.</seg>
<seg id="1517">很久以前，所有的河流都向海洋抱怨，从河里流到海里的水变咸了。</seg>
<seg id="1518">"When we come to you," said they to the Sea, "we are sweet and drinkable:</seg>
<seg id="1518">“当我们流向你，”河流对海洋说，“我们本是甘甜可口的，</seg>
<seg id="1519">but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own."</seg>
<seg id="1519">但一旦当我们混入你那里之后，我们的水就变得像你一样，咸涩不能喝了。”</seg>
<seg id="1520">The Sea replied shortly, "Keep away from me and you'll remain sweet."</seg>
<seg id="1520">海洋不耐烦地回答：“请离我远点儿吧，那样你们仍是甘甜的。”</seg>
<seg id="1521">THE LION IN LOVE</seg>
<seg id="1521">恋爱中的狮子</seg>
<seg id="1522">A Lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted to marry her;</seg>
<seg id="1522">狮子深深地爱上了一位佃农的女儿，想要娶她，</seg>
<seg id="1523">but her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome a husband, and yet didn't want to offend the Lion;</seg>
<seg id="1523">但女孩的父亲不愿把女儿许配给如此可怕的一头野兽，但又不想触怒狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1524">so he hit upon the following expedient.</seg>
<seg id="1524">忽然他想到了一个权宜之计。</seg>
<seg id="1525">He went to the Lion and said, "I think you will make a very good husband for my daughter:</seg>
<seg id="1525">佃农对狮子说：“我想，你为了我的女儿，将会成为一个很好的丈夫。</seg>
<seg id="1526">but I cannot consent to your union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my daughter is terribly afraid of them."</seg>
<seg id="1526">但我不能同意你结婚，除非你让我拔了你的牙齿、削了你的利爪，因为我的女儿非常害怕你的爪牙。”</seg>
<seg id="1527">The Lion was so much in love that he readily agreed that this should be done.</seg>
<seg id="1527">热恋中的狮子欣然同意了。</seg>
<seg id="1528">When once, however, he was thus disarmed, the Cottager was afraid of him no longer, but drove him away with his club.</seg>
<seg id="1528">然而，当狮子一失去了爪牙，佃农就不再害怕它，用棍棒把它赶了出去。</seg>
<seg id="1529">THE BEE-KEEPER</seg>
<seg id="1529">养蜂人</seg>
<seg id="1530">A Thief found his way into an apiary when the Bee-keeper was away, and stole all the honey.</seg>
<seg id="1530">小偷趁养蜂人离开的时候，潜入养蜂场，偷走了所有的蜂蜜。</seg>
<seg id="1531">When the Keeper returned and found the hives empty, he was very much upset and stood staring at them for some time.</seg>
<seg id="1531">当养蜂人回来，发现蜂巢空空如也时，非常懊恼，他站在那儿呆呆地盯了好一会儿。</seg>
<seg id="1532">Before long the bees came back from gathering honey, and, finding their hives overturned and the Keeper standing by, they made for him with their stings.</seg>
<seg id="1532">不久，蜜蜂们采蜜回来了，发现蜂巢被搅，而养蜂人站在一旁，它们就用自身的毒针蜇刺养蜂人。</seg>
<seg id="1533">At this he fell into a passion and cried, "You ungrateful scoundrels, you let the thief who stole my honey get off scot-free, and then you go and sting me who have always taken such care of you!"</seg>
<seg id="1533">这时，养蜂人极为愤怒地喊道：“你们这群忘恩负义的混蛋，让偷蜂蜜的小偷轻轻松松地跑了，然后就来蜇我这个一直照顾你们的人！”</seg>
<seg id="1534">When you hit back make sure you have got the right man.</seg>
<seg id="1534">当你进行报复时，要找对人。</seg>
<seg id="1535">THE WOLF AND THE HORSE</seg>
<seg id="1535">狼和马</seg>
<seg id="1536">A Wolf on his rambles came to a field of oats, but, not being able to eat them, he was passing on his way when a Horse came along.</seg>
<seg id="1536">狼走着走着来到了一片麦田，由于它不吃大麦，所以就继续往前走。这时，一匹马过来了。</seg>
<seg id="1537">"Look," said the Wolf, "here's a fine field of oats.</seg>
<seg id="1537">“瞧，”狼说，“这里有一片多好的麦田啊。</seg>
<seg id="1538">For your sake I have left it untouched, and I shall greatly enjoy the sound of your teeth munching the ripe grain."</seg>
<seg id="1538">我是为你保留的，因为我非常喜欢你大声咀嚼成熟谷物的那种声音。”</seg>
<seg id="1539">But the Horse replied, "If wolves could eat oats, my fine friend, you would hardly have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."</seg>
<seg id="1539">然而，马却回答：“假如狼会吃大麦，我亲爱的朋友，你几乎不可能只满足耳朵的享受，而以饿肚子为代价了。”</seg>
<seg id="1540">There is no virtue in giving to others what is useless to oneself.</seg>
<seg id="1540">给他人对自己没用的信息，绝非出于善意。</seg>
<seg id="1541">THE BAT, THE BRAMBLE, AND THE SEAGULL</seg>
<seg id="1541">蝙蝠、荆棘和海鸥</seg>
<seg id="1542">A Bat, a Bramble, and a Seagull went into partnership and determined to go on a trading voyage together.</seg>
<seg id="1542">蝙蝠、荆棘和海鸥合伙决定一起去海上做贸易。</seg>
<seg id="1543">The Bat borrowed a sum of money for his venture; the Bramble laid in a stock of clothes of various kinds; and the Seagull took a quantity of lead:</seg>
<seg id="1543">蝙蝠为这次贸易投资借来一笔钱，荆棘储备了一批各式各样的常用衣服，海鸥则带了一些铅。</seg>
<seg id="1544">and so they set out.</seg>
<seg id="1544">就这样，它们出发了。</seg>
<seg id="1545">By and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo went to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land.</seg>
<seg id="1545">不久，一场飓风暴雨袭来，它们连船带货沉到了海底，但它们仨想方设法到达了陆地。</seg>
<seg id="1546">Ever since then the Seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every now and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost;</seg>
<seg id="1546">从此以后，海鸥来回地在海上飞翔，有时潜到海底，寻找丢失的铅；</seg>
<seg id="1547">while the Bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away by day and only comes out at night to feed;</seg>
<seg id="1547">同时，蝙蝠害怕遇见债主，白天躲了起来，只在晚上出来觅食；</seg>
<seg id="1548">and the Bramble catches hold of the clothes of every one who passes by, hoping some day to recognise and recover the lost garments.</seg>
<seg id="1548">荆棘抓住每位路人的衣服，希望有一天能认出并找回自己丢失的衣服。</seg>
<seg id="1549">All men are more concerned to recover what they lose than to acquire what they lack.</seg>
<seg id="1549">人们更关注找回失去的东西，而忽略了去寻找缺失的东西。</seg>
<seg id="1550">THE DOG AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1550">狗和狼</seg>
<seg id="1551">A Dog was lying in the sun before a farmyard gate when a Wolf pounced upon him and was just going to eat him up;</seg>
<seg id="1551">狗正躺在农家宅院门口晒太阳，一匹狼突然扑过来，想把它吃了。</seg>
<seg id="1552">but he begged for his life and said, "You see how thin I am and what a wretched meal I should make you now:</seg>
<seg id="1552">但狗请求狼饶命，说道：“你瞧，我多瘦啊！现在的我对你来说只是一顿太糟糕的午餐，</seg>
<seg id="1553">but if you will only wait a few days my master is going to give a feast.</seg>
<seg id="1553">可如果你能等几天，我的主人将要举办一场宴会，</seg>
<seg id="1554">All the rich scraps and pickings will fall to me and I shall get nice and fat:</seg>
<seg id="1554">所有丰富的残羹剩饭都会落到我的肚里，我会变得更肥更壮，</seg>
<seg id="1555">then will be the time for you to eat me."</seg>
<seg id="1555">那时就是你吃我的好时机了。”</seg>
<seg id="1556">The Wolf thought this was a very good plan and went away.</seg>
<seg id="1556">狼心想，这是一个好主意，然后就离开了。</seg>
<seg id="1557">Some time afterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the Dog lying out of reach on the stable roof.</seg>
<seg id="1557">过了一些日子，狼又来到农家宅院，发现狗躺在它够不到的屋顶上。</seg>
<seg id="1558">"Come down," he called, "and be eaten: you remember our agreement?"</seg>
<seg id="1558">“下来，”狼喊道，“你还记得我们的约定吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1559">But the Dog said coolly, "My friend, if ever you catch me lying down by the gate there again, don't you wait for any feast."</seg>
<seg id="1559">然而，狗却冷冷地说：“朋友，如果你再在门口逮到躺在那儿的我，就不要再等什么宴会了。”</seg>
<seg id="1560">Once bitten, twice shy.</seg>
<seg id="1560">一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳。</seg>
<seg id="1561">THE WASP AND THE SNAKE</seg>
<seg id="1561">黄蜂和蛇</seg>
<seg id="1562">A Wasp settled on the head of a Snake, and not only stung him several times, but clung obstinately to the head of his victim.</seg>
<seg id="1562">一只黄蜂停在一条蛇的头顶上，不但蜇叮了蛇好几次，而且还牢牢地抓住蛇头。</seg>
<seg id="1563">Maddened with pain the Snake tried every means he could think of to get rid of the creature, but without success.</seg>
<seg id="1563">蛇痛苦得大怒，尝试所能想到的各种各样的办法，想摆脱这只黄蜂，但都无济于事。</seg>
<seg id="1564">At last he became desperate, and crying, "Kill you I will, even at the cost of my own life,"</seg>
<seg id="1564">最后，蛇绝望地哭喊道：“我一定要把你杀掉，即使以我的生命为代价。”</seg>
<seg id="1565">he laid his head with the Wasp on it under the wheel of a passing waggon, and they both perished together.</seg>
<seg id="1565">它带着黄蜂，把头钻到一辆过路马车的车轮底下，它俩同归于尽了。</seg>
<seg id="1566">THE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE</seg>
<seg id="1566">鹰和甲虫</seg>
<seg id="1567">An Eagle was chasing a hare, which was running for dear life and was at her wits' end to know where to turn for help.</seg>
<seg id="1567">鹰追捕一只野兔，野兔为了活命飞快地奔跑，它绞尽脑汁想知道去哪儿可以寻求帮助。</seg>
<seg id="1568">Presently she espied a Beetle, and begged it to aid her.</seg>
<seg id="1568">这时，野兔看到了一只甲虫，就请求甲虫救它。</seg>
<seg id="1569">So when the Eagle came up the Beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its protection.</seg>
<seg id="1569">于是，当鹰飞扑过来时，甲虫警告鹰，不要伤害野兔，因为野兔是受它保护的。</seg>
<seg id="1570">But the Eagle never noticed the Beetle because it was so small, seized the hare and ate her up.</seg>
<seg id="1570">但甲虫实在太小了，鹰根本没注意到它，抓起野兔就一口吃了。</seg>
<seg id="1571">The Beetle never forgot this, and used to keep an eye on the Eagle's nest, and whenever the Eagle laid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it.</seg>
<seg id="1571">甲虫对此耿耿于怀，经常盯着鹰巢，每当鹰一下蛋，它就爬上去把蛋推出鹰巢，摔个稀巴烂。</seg>
<seg id="1572">At last the Eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she went up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of Eagles, and begged him to give her a safe place to nest in:</seg>
<seg id="1572">终于，鹰对自己的蛋总是被打破感到非常焦虑，便去找守护神朱庇特，请求他给自己一个安全的地方筑巢。</seg>
<seg id="1573">so he let her lay her eggs in his lap.</seg>
<seg id="1573">于是，朱庇特让鹰在他的大腿上下蛋。</seg>
<seg id="1574">But the Beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size of an Eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap.</seg>
<seg id="1574">然而，甲虫发现了这一情况，就做了一个和鹰蛋一样大小的泥球，然后爬上去把泥球放到朱庇特的大腿上。</seg>
<seg id="1575">When Jupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and, forgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken just as before.</seg>
<seg id="1575">当朱庇特见到这泥团，便站起来把它从袍子上抖落，却忘记了大腿上还有蛋，蛋随泥团被一同抖落，和之前一样又摔破了。</seg>
<seg id="1576">Ever since then, they say, Eagles never lay their eggs at the season when Beetles are about.</seg>
<seg id="1576">据说，从此以后，鹰决不会在甲虫出没的季节下蛋了。</seg>
<seg id="1577">The weak will sometimes find ways to avenge an insult, even upon the strong.</seg>
<seg id="1577">面对强者，弱者有时会用自己的方式去报复强者的侵犯。</seg>
<seg id="1578">THE FOWLER AND THE LARK</seg>
<seg id="1578">捕鸟人和云雀</seg>
<seg id="1579">A Fowler was setting his nets for little birds when a Lark came up to him and asked him what he was doing.</seg>
<seg id="1579">捕鸟人正在布网准备捕鸟，一只云雀飞到他的跟前，问他在干什么。</seg>
<seg id="1580">"I am engaged in founding a city," said he, and with that he withdrew to a short distance and concealed himself.</seg>
<seg id="1580">“我正忙着建造城市。”捕鸟人说道。同时，他走开躲了起来。</seg>
<seg id="1581">The Lark examined the nets with great curiosity, and presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order to secure it, and became entangled in the meshes.</seg>
<seg id="1581">云雀十分好奇地仔细检查了一下网，一下看到了诱饵，为了将它得到手就飞了进去，结果陷入网中。</seg>
<seg id="1582">The Fowler then ran up quickly and captured her.</seg>
<seg id="1582">捕鸟人快步跑来抓住了云雀。</seg>
<seg id="1583">"What a fool I was!" said she:</seg>
<seg id="1583">“我真是个傻瓜！”云雀说，</seg>
<seg id="1584">"but at any rate, if that's the kind of city you are founding, it'll be a long time before you find fools enough to fill it."</seg>
<seg id="1584">“如果那就是你建造的城市，至少需要很长时间，你才会发现有足够多的傻瓜前来入住。”</seg>
<seg id="1585">THE FISHERMAN PIPING</seg>
<seg id="1585">吹笛的渔夫</seg>
<seg id="1586">A Fisherman who could play the flute went down one day to the sea-shore with his nets and his flute;</seg>
<seg id="1586">有一天，一位擅长吹笛的渔夫带着渔网和长笛来到海边，</seg>
<seg id="1587">and, taking his stand on a projecting rock, began to play a tune, thinking that the music would bring the fish jumping out of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1587">他站在一块突出的岩石上开始吹奏曲子，心想，音乐会吸引鱼儿从海里跳出来。</seg>
<seg id="1588">He went on playing for some time, but not a fish appeared:</seg>
<seg id="1588">他吹了好久，但一条鱼儿也没出来，</seg>
<seg id="1589">so at last he threw down his flute and cast his net into the sea, and made a great haul of fish.</seg>
<seg id="1589">最后他扔下长笛，把渔网撒向海里，捕到了满满一网的鱼。</seg>
<seg id="1590">When they were landed and he saw them leaping about on the shore, he cried, "You rascals!</seg>
<seg id="1590">他把鱼儿拖上岸，看着它们在岸上活蹦乱跳的样子，大声说：“你们这些淘气的家伙！</seg>
<seg id="1591">you wouldn't dance when I piped:</seg>
<seg id="1591">我吹笛时，你们不肯跳出来；</seg>
<seg id="1592">but now I've stopped, you can do nothing else!"</seg>
<seg id="1592">现在我不吹了，你们却跳得起劲！”</seg>
<seg id="1593">THE PLOUGHMAN, THE ASS, AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1593">农夫、驴和牛</seg>
<seg id="1594">A Ploughman yoked his Ox and his Ass together, and set to work to plough his field.</seg>
<seg id="1594">农夫给牛和驴一起套上轭，去田里耕地。</seg>
<seg id="1595">It was a poor makeshift of a team, but it was the best he could do, as he had but a single Ox.</seg>
<seg id="1595">这是一个不得已的办法，也是农夫所能想到的最好的办法，因为他只有一头牛。</seg>
<seg id="1596">At the end of the day, when the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the Ass said to the Ox, "Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?"</seg>
<seg id="1596">在农活结束的最后一天，牛和驴都解了轭套，驴对牛说：“我们都经历了一段辛苦的日子：我们谁来带主人回家？”</seg>
<seg id="1597">The Ox looked surprised at the question. "Why," said he, "you, to be sure, as usual."</seg>
<seg id="1597">牛对这个问题似乎很惊讶，它说：“和往常一样，肯定是你啦。”</seg>

<seg id="1599">Demades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens;</seg>
<seg id="1599">有一次，演说家泽马德斯在雅典作公开演讲，</seg>
<seg id="1600">but the people were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped and said, "Gentlemen, I should like to tell you one of Æsop's fables."</seg>
<seg id="1600">而听众却心不在焉地听他在讲，泽马德斯因此停下来，说：“先生们，我想给你们讲一则伊索寓言。”</seg>
<seg id="1601">This made every one listen intently.</seg>
<seg id="1601">这使得人人都专心致志地听他演讲。</seg>
<seg id="1602">Then Demades began: "Demeter, a Swallow, and an Eel were once travelling together, and came to a river without a bridge:</seg>
<seg id="1602">泽马德斯开讲道：“女神得墨忒耳曾经和燕子、鳗鱼一起出游，她们来到一条没有桥的河，</seg>
<seg id="1603">the Swallow flew over it, and the Eel swam across";</seg>
<seg id="1603">燕子飞了过去，鳗鱼游了过去。”</seg>
<seg id="1604">and then he stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1604">接着他不吭声。</seg>
<seg id="1605">"What happened to Demeter?" cried several people in the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1605">“得墨忒耳怎么样了？”听众中有几个人喊道。</seg>
<seg id="1606">"Demeter," he replied, "is very angry with you for listening to fables when you ought to be minding public business."</seg>
<seg id="1606">“得墨忒耳，”他回答说，“对你们非常生气，因为你们只顾听寓言，根本不关心公共事务。”</seg>
<seg id="1607">THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN</seg>
<seg id="1607">猴子和海豚</seg>
<seg id="1608">When people go on a voyage they often take with them lap-dogs or monkeys as pets to wile away the time.</seg>
<seg id="1608">人们出海远航时，经常随身带着哈巴狗或猴子等宠物来消磨时间。</seg>
<seg id="1609">Thus it fell out that a man returning to Athens from the East had a pet Monkey on board with him.</seg>
<seg id="1609">因此，有一个人在从东方返回雅典的船上随身带了一只宠物猴。</seg>
<seg id="1610">As they neared the coast of Attica a great storm burst upon them, and the ship capsized.</seg>
<seg id="1610">当他们靠近阿提卡海岸时，突然遭遇了狂风大浪的袭击，航船在风浪中翻没。</seg>
<seg id="1611">All on board were thrown into the water, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1611">船上所有的一切都落入水中，人们试图通过游泳逃生，猴子也在其中。</seg>
<seg id="1612">A Dolphin saw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and began swimming towards the shore.</seg>
<seg id="1612">一条海豚看见了猴子，以为是一个人，就把猴子背在自己的背上，向岸边游去。</seg>
<seg id="1613">When they got near the Piræus, which is the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an Athenian.</seg>
<seg id="1613">当它们到达希腊东南部港口比雷埃夫斯时，海豚问猴子是不是雅典人。</seg>
<seg id="1614">The Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished family.</seg>
<seg id="1614">猴子回答说是的，并且说自己来自一个非常有名望的家族。</seg>
<seg id="1615">"Then, of course, you know the Piræus," continued the Dolphin.</seg>
<seg id="1615">“那么，你自然知道比雷埃夫斯喽？”海豚继续问道。</seg>
<seg id="1616">The Monkey thought he was referring to some high official or other, and replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very old friend of mine."</seg>
<seg id="1616">猴子以为海豚提及的是一些高官或其他人，便回答说：“噢，是的，他是我的老朋友。”</seg>
<seg id="1617">At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the Dolphin was so disgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate Monkey was quickly drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1617">由此，海豚发现了猴子的虚伪，它极其恼怒，当即潜入水下，不幸的猴子很快被淹死了。</seg>
<seg id="1618">THE CROW AND THE SNAKE</seg>
<seg id="1618">乌鸦和蛇</seg>
<seg id="1619">A hungry Crow spied a Snake lying asleep in a sunny spot, and, picking it up in his claws, he was carrying it off to a place where he could make a meal of it without being disturbed, when the Snake reared its head and bit him.</seg>
<seg id="1619">一只饥饿的乌鸦看见一条蛇躺在阳光下睡着了，于是就把它抓住，带到一个不受干扰的地方，想美餐一顿。这时，蛇抬头咬了乌鸦一口。</seg>
<seg id="1620">It was a poisonous Snake, and the bite was fatal, and the dying Crow said, "What a cruel fate is mine!</seg>
<seg id="1620">这是一条毒蛇，被它咬到必死无疑。乌鸦临终前说：“我的命运太悲惨了！</seg>
<seg id="1621">I thought I had made a lucky find, and it has cost me my life!"</seg>
<seg id="1621">我以为找到了一顿美食，结果却付出了自己的生命！”</seg>
<seg id="1622">THE DOGS AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1622">狗和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1623">Some Dogs once found a lion's skin, and were worrying it with their teeth.</seg>
<seg id="1623">有一次，几只狗发现了一张狮子的皮毛，就用牙齿去撕咬。</seg>
<seg id="1624">Just then a Fox came by, and said, "You think yourselves very brave, no doubt;</seg>
<seg id="1624">正在这时，一只狐狸走过来，说：“毫无疑问，你们认为自己非常勇敢，</seg>
<seg id="1625">but if that were a live lion you'd find his claws a good deal sharper than your teeth."</seg>
<seg id="1625">但如果那是一头活的狮子，你们就会发现它的爪子比你们的牙齿尖锐多了。”</seg>
<seg id="1626">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE HAWK</seg>
<seg id="1626">夜莺和老鹰</seg>
<seg id="1627">A Nightingale was sitting on a bough of an oak and singing, as her custom was.</seg>
<seg id="1627">夜莺像往常一样在树枝上唱歌，</seg>
<seg id="1628">A hungry Hawk presently spied her, and darting to the spot seized her in his talons.</seg>
<seg id="1628">一只饥饿的老鹰突然发现了它，飞扑过来用爪子把它攫走。</seg>
<seg id="1629">He was just about to tear her in pieces when she begged him to spare her life:</seg>
<seg id="1629">老鹰正打算把它撕成碎块吃了的时候，夜莺恳求老鹰饶命。</seg>
<seg id="1630">"I'm not big enough," she pleaded, "to make you a good meal:</seg>
<seg id="1630">“我还不够大，”夜莺说，“不能填饱你的肚子，</seg>
<seg id="1631">you ought to seek your prey among the bigger birds."</seg>
<seg id="1631">你应该在大一点的鸟儿中寻找你的猎物。”</seg>
<seg id="1632">The Hawk eyed her with some contempt. "You must think me very simple," said he, "if you suppose I am going to give up a certain prize on the chance of a better of which I see at present no signs."</seg>
<seg id="1632">老鹰有些轻蔑地瞥了它一眼，说：“如果你以为我会放弃已到手的奖赏，而对目前还遥无影踪的好东西怀有希望，那你肯定认为我头脑太简单了。”</seg>
<seg id="1633">THE ROSE AND THE AMARANTH</seg>
<seg id="1633">玫瑰和不凋谢的花</seg>
<seg id="1634">A Rose and an Amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden, and the Amaranth said to her neighbour, "How I envy you your beauty and your sweet scent!</seg>
<seg id="1634">花园里，一株玫瑰和一株不凋谢的花一并盛放，不凋谢的花对玫瑰说：“我多么羡慕你的美丽和芳香！</seg>
<seg id="1635">No wonder you are such a universal favourite."</seg>
<seg id="1635">怪不得你是众人喜爱的花朵。”</seg>
<seg id="1636">But the Rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, "Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time:</seg>
<seg id="1636">但玫瑰略带哀伤地回答说：“啊，亲爱的朋友，我开花不过一段时间，</seg>
<seg id="1637">my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die.</seg>
<seg id="1637">我的花瓣很快会枯萎凋落，然后就结束了生命。</seg>
<seg id="1638">But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for they are everlasting."</seg>
<seg id="1638">而你的花是永不凋谢的，即使被修剪，也是为了永久长青。”</seg>
<seg id="1639">THE MAN, THE HORSE, THE OX, AND THE DOG</seg>
<seg id="1639">人、马、牛、狗</seg>
<seg id="1640">One winter's day, during a severe storm, a Horse, an Ox, and a Dog came and begged for shelter in the house of a Man.</seg>
<seg id="1640">一个狂风暴雪的冬日，马、牛、狗来到人的屋子里请求庇护。</seg>
<seg id="1641">He readily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort:</seg>
<seg id="1641">人欣然接受了它们，动物们又冷又湿，人就点火给它们取暖。</seg>
<seg id="1642">and he put oats before the Horse, and hay before the Ox, while he fed the Dog with the remains of his own dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1642">人在马的面前放了燕麦，在牛的面前放了干草，同时把自己吃剩的食物喂给狗吃。</seg>
<seg id="1643">When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the following way.</seg>
<seg id="1643">当暴风雪小下来时，马、牛、狗打算告辞了，它们决定用以下方法来表达自己的感谢：</seg>
<seg id="1644">They divided the life of Man among them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his own.</seg>
<seg id="1644">三种动物要把自己的寿命分给人，每种动物捐出自己最有特质的一部分寿命。</seg>
<seg id="1645">The Horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint;</seg>
<seg id="1645">马带给人的是年轻时期，因此年轻人精神饱满，不能忍受约束；</seg>
<seg id="1646">the Ox took middle age, and accordingly men in middle life are steady and hard-working;</seg>
<seg id="1646">牛带给人的是中年时期，因此人到中年处事稳重、工作努力；</seg>
<seg id="1647">while the Dog took old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.</seg>
<seg id="1647">而狗带给人的是老年时期，因此老年人常常容易发怒、脾气暴躁，认为首先应该追求安逸的生活，同时他们厌恶不熟悉或不喜欢的人。</seg>
<seg id="1648">THE WOLVES, THE SHEEP, AND THE RAM</seg>
<seg id="1648">狼、绵羊和公羊</seg>
<seg id="1649">The Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death.</seg>
<seg id="1649">狼派了一个代表团去绵羊那儿，建议双方言归于好，条件是绵羊交出牧羊犬，并立即处死。</seg>
<seg id="1650">The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms;</seg>
<seg id="1650">愚蠢的绵羊答应了狼的条件，</seg>
<seg id="1651">but an old Ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at peace with you?</seg>
<seg id="1651">但一头年迈的公羊见多识广，前来干涉，它说：“我们怎么知道能与你们和平相处呢？</seg>
<seg id="1652">Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"</seg>
<seg id="1652">因为即使有牧羊犬在边上保护我们，由于你们的凶残袭击，我们也从没安全过！”</seg>
<seg id="1653">THE SWAN</seg>
<seg id="1653">天鹅</seg>
<seg id="1654">The Swan is said to sing but once in its life--when it knows that it is about to die.</seg>
<seg id="1654">传说天鹅直到临死时才唱歌。</seg>
<seg id="1655">A certain man, who had heard of the song of the Swan, one day saw one of these birds for sale in the market, and bought it and took it home with him.</seg>
<seg id="1655">一天，有个听到过天鹅歌唱的人，看到市场上在卖这种鸟，就买了一只带回家。</seg>
<seg id="1656">A few days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the Swan, and bade it sing for their entertainment: but the Swan remained silent.</seg>
<seg id="1656">几天后，他请一些朋友来吃饭，于是就叫天鹅唱歌为他们助兴，但天鹅一直保持沉默。</seg>
<seg id="1657">In course of time, when it was growing old, it became aware of its approaching end and broke into a sweet, sad song.</seg>
<seg id="1657">随着时间的流逝，天鹅渐渐衰老了，它意识到自己的大限将临，哀伤地唱起了挽歌。</seg>
<seg id="1658">When its owner heard it, he said angrily, "If the creature only sings when it is about to die, what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song!</seg>
<seg id="1658">主人听到了它的歌声，恼怒地说：“如果这家伙只在临死前唱歌，那我那天想听它的歌声未免太傻了！</seg>
<seg id="1659">I ought to have wrung its neck instead of merely inviting it to sing."</seg>
<seg id="1659">我应该拧断它的脖子，而不是请它去唱歌。”</seg>
<seg id="1660">THE SNAKE AND JUPITER</seg>
<seg id="1660">蛇和朱庇特</seg>
<seg id="1661">A Snake suffered a good deal from being constantly trodden upon by man and beast, owing partly to the length of his body and partly to his being unable to raise himself above the surface of the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1661">蛇受尽了经常被人类和百兽践踏之苦，一部分原因是它的身形，另一部分原因是它不能在地面上直立行走。</seg>
<seg id="1662">so he went and complained to Jupiter about the risks to which he was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="1662">于是，蛇向朱庇特抱怨自己所遭受的危险。</seg>
<seg id="1663">But Jupiter had little sympathy for him.</seg>
<seg id="1663">但朱庇特对它毫不同情。</seg>
<seg id="1664">"I dare say," said he, "that if you had bitten the first that trod on you, the others would have taken more trouble to look where they put their feet."</seg>
<seg id="1664">“我敢说，”朱庇特说道，“如果你被第一个人踩到后就咬他，其他人就会好好看看他们的脚该放在哪里。”</seg>
<seg id="1665">THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW</seg>
<seg id="1665">狼和影子</seg>
<seg id="1666">A Wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was getting low in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his shadow, and said to himself, "I had no idea I was so big.</seg>
<seg id="1666">太阳下山时，一匹狼走在平原上，它那长长的影子令它非常惊讶，“我不知道自己有这么高大。</seg>
<seg id="1667">Fancy my being afraid of a lion!</seg>
<seg id="1667">我不用害怕狮子了！</seg>
<seg id="1668">Why, I, not he, ought to be King of the beasts";</seg>
<seg id="1668">不用因为它是百兽之王，再怕它了。”</seg>
<seg id="1669">and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there could be no doubt at all about it.</seg>
<seg id="1669">狼一边说着，根本没有注意到周围的危险，它得意忘形地走着。</seg>
<seg id="1670">Just then a lion sprang upon him and began to devour him.</seg>
<seg id="1670">就在这时，一头狮子突然向狼扑过来，虎视眈眈地盯着它。</seg>
<seg id="1671">"Alas," he cried, "had I not lost sight of the facts, I shouldn't have been ruined by my fancies."</seg>
<seg id="1671">“哎呀，”狼哭喊道，“如果我没有忘记眼前的事实，就不会被自己的幻想给毁了。”</seg>
<seg id="1672">THE PLOUGHMAN AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1672">农夫和狼</seg>
<seg id="1673">A Ploughman loosed his oxen from the plough, and led them away to the water to drink.</seg>
<seg id="1673">农夫从犁上松开牛轭，牵着牛群到湖边去喝水。</seg>
<seg id="1674">While he was absent a half-starved Wolf appeared on the scene, and went up to the plough and began chewing the leather straps attached to the yoke.</seg>
<seg id="1674">趁他不注意的时候，一头饿狼出现了，走到犁边上，开始咬套在牛轭上的皮带。</seg>
<seg id="1675">As he gnawed away desperately in the hope of satisfying his craving for food, he somehow got entangled in the harness, and, taking fright, struggled to get free, tugging at the traces as if he would drag the plough along with him.</seg>
<seg id="1675">狼拼命地咬，希望借此满足对食物的欲望，却不知怎的被套进了牛轭。它十分惊恐，挣扎着想要出来，眼看拖着犁似乎快要滑入犁沟了。</seg>
<seg id="1676">Just then the Ploughman came back, and seeing what was happening, he cried, "Ah, you old rascal, I wish you would give up thieving for good and take to honest work instead."</seg>
<seg id="1676">正在那时，农夫回来了，看见狼被牛轭套住，便大声说道：“啊，你这个老无赖，但愿你永远不再偷窃掠夺，而能老老实实地干活。”</seg>
<seg id="1677">MERCURY AND THE MAN BITTEN BY AN ANT</seg>
<seg id="1677">墨丘利和被蚂蚁咬了的人</seg>
<seg id="1678">A Man once saw a ship go down with all its crew, and commented severely on the injustice of the gods.</seg>
<seg id="1678">从前，有个人看见一艘船连同船上所有的人都一起淹没了，于是强烈指责神明处罚不公。</seg>
<seg id="1679">"They care nothing for a man's character," said he, "but let the good and the bad go to their deaths together."</seg>
<seg id="1679">“他们根本不在乎一个人的人品，”他说，“让好人和坏人一起死了。”</seg>
<seg id="1680">There was an ant-heap close by where he was standing, and, just as he spoke, he was bitten in the foot by an Ant.</seg>
<seg id="1680">就在他说话时，有一群蚂蚁在他站的位置边上，他的脚被一只蚂蚁咬了一口。</seg>
<seg id="1681">Turning in a temper to the ant-heap he stamped upon it and crushed hundreds of unoffending ants.</seg>
<seg id="1681">他转而把怒气对着那群蚂蚁，一脚踩下去，踩死了数百只无辜的蚂蚁。</seg>
<seg id="1682">Suddenly Mercury appeared, and belaboured him with his staff, saying as he did so, "You villain, where's your nice sense of justice now?"</seg>
<seg id="1682">突然，墨丘利出现了，一边用手杖痛打他，一边按他先前所言回击道：“你这坏蛋，现在你那强烈的正义感在哪儿呀？”</seg>
<seg id="1683">THE PARROT AND THE CAT</seg>
<seg id="1683">鹦鹉和猫</seg>
<seg id="1684">A Man once bought a Parrot and gave it the run of his house.</seg>
<seg id="1684">从前，有个人买了一只鹦鹉放养在家里。</seg>
<seg id="1685">It revelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece and screamed away to its heart's content.</seg>
<seg id="1685">鹦鹉很高兴能自由自在地在屋子里飞来飞去。不一会儿，鹦鹉飞到了壁炉架上，尽情地发出尖叫声。</seg>
<seg id="1686">The noise disturbed the Cat, who was asleep on the hearthrug.</seg>
<seg id="1686">这声音吵到了在炉前地毯上酣睡的猫。</seg>
<seg id="1687">Looking up at the intruder, she said, "Who may you be, and where have you come from?"</seg>
<seg id="1687">猫抬头看着这位不速之客，说：“你是谁，从哪儿来的？”</seg>
<seg id="1688">The Parrot replied, "Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him."</seg>
<seg id="1688">鹦鹉回答：“你的主人刚刚把我买来，是他带我来到这个家里的。”</seg>
<seg id="1689">"You impudent bird," said the Cat, "how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise like that?</seg>
<seg id="1689">“你这只无礼的鸟儿，”猫说，“作为一个新来者，怎么敢制造出那样难听的声音？</seg>
<seg id="1690">Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and yet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all over the place."</seg>
<seg id="1690">而我生在这里，长在这里，假如我敢喵喵叫，他们就会朝我扔东西，并且到处追捕我了。”</seg>
<seg id="1691">"Look here, mistress," said the Parrot, "you just hold your tongue.</seg>
<seg id="1691">“听我说，小姐，”鹦鹉说，“你最好闭嘴。</seg>
<seg id="1692">My voice they delight in; but yours--yours is a perfect nuisance."</seg>
<seg id="1692">他们喜欢我的声音，而你的声音——简直太讨厌了。”</seg>
<seg id="1693">THE STAG AND THE LION</seg>

<seg id="1694">一头雄鹿被一群猎犬追捕，逃到一个洞穴避难，希望在那儿能躲避追捕者，得以安全逃生。</seg>

<seg id="1695">不幸的是，这个洞穴里住着一头狮子，雄鹿却沦为狮子轻而易举到手的猎物。</seg>
<seg id="1696">"Unhappy that I am," he cried, "I am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of a Lion."</seg>
<seg id="1696">“我真不幸啊，”雄鹿哭喊道，“我逃过了猎犬的追捕，却落入狮子的手中。”</seg>

<seg id="1699">有个人生病了，病得非常严重，于是他向神灵起誓，如果能让他康复，他愿意献出一百头牛给神灵。</seg>
<seg id="1700">Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they caused him to recover in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1700">神灵想看看他能否遵守承诺，便很快让他恢复了健康。</seg>
<seg id="1701">Now, he hadn't an ox in the world, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar, at the same time saying, "Ye gods, I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow."</seg>
<seg id="1701">事实上，他一头牛也没有，于是他用油脂做了一百头小牛供放在祭坛上，同时说道：“神灵啊，我请你们见证，我已履行了誓言。”</seg>
<seg id="1702">The gods determined to be even with him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there.</seg>
<seg id="1702">神灵决定教训一下他，就让他做了一个梦，他梦见自己被派去海边，那里可以领取一百个银币。</seg>
<seg id="1703">Hastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of robbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and when they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.</seg>
<seg id="1703">他兴高采烈地跑到海边，却落入一群强盗手中。强盗抓住了他，把他带走当奴隶卖了，卖的价格正好是一百个银币。</seg>

<seg id="1705">狗和牛皮</seg>
<seg id="1706">Once upon a time a number of Dogs, who were famished with hunger, saw some Hides steeping in a river, but couldn't get at them because the water was too deep.</seg>
<seg id="1706">从前，有许多饥肠辘辘的狗，看见一些牛皮浸泡在河里，但由于河水太深了，它们够不着。</seg>
<seg id="1707">So they put their heads together, and decided to drink away at the river till it was shallow enough for them to reach the Hides.</seg>
<seg id="1707">于是它们一起商量，决定喝干河里的水，直到牛皮完全露出来，它们能够得着为止。</seg>
<seg id="1708">But long before that happened they burst themselves with drinking.</seg>
<seg id="1708">然而还没等它们得到牛皮，就已经喝了太多的水，肚子都要撑破了。</seg>

<seg id="1714">然后，狮子用愤怒的目光注视着狐狸，命令它进行重新分配。</seg>

<seg id="1715">狐狸几乎把所有的猎物都堆在一起，把一份最大的给狮子，仅给自己留了很小的一口。</seg>

<seg id="1717">The Fox replied, "Me?</seg>
<seg id="1717">狐狸回答：“我吗？</seg>
<seg id="1718">Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass."</seg>
<seg id="1718">噢，我是从驴那儿得到了教训。”</seg>
<seg id="1719">Happy is he who learns from the misfortunes of others.</seg>
<seg id="1719">吸取他人教训，自己才会走运。</seg>
<seg id="1720">THE FOWLER, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE COCK</seg>
<seg id="1720">捕鸟人、山鹑和公鸡</seg>
<seg id="1721">One day, as a Fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and bread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="1721">一天，当捕鸟人正坐下来吃只有蔬菜和面包的简便晚餐时，一位朋友突然前来拜访。</seg>
<seg id="1722">The larder was empty;</seg>
<seg id="1722">家里的餐橱已空空荡荡，</seg>
<seg id="1723">so he went out and caught a tame Partridge, which he kept as a decoy, and was about to wring her neck when she cried, "Surely you won't kill me?</seg>
<seg id="1723">于是，捕鸟人出去抓了一只温顺的山鹑，这只山鹑是他留作诱饵的。捕鸟人正要扭断山鹑的脖子时，山鹑哭喊道：“你一定不会杀了我吧？</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why, what will you do without me next time you go fowling?</seg>
<seg id="1724">因为没有我，你下次怎么去捕鸟？</seg>
<seg id="1725">How will you get the birds to come to your nets?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">你如何把鸟引到你的网里来呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1726">He let her go at this, and went to his hen-house, where he had a plump young Cock.</seg>
<seg id="1726">捕鸟人就把山鹑放走了，去鸡舍挑了一只小公鸡。</seg>
<seg id="1727">When the Cock saw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, "If you kill me, how will you know the time of night?</seg>
<seg id="1727">公鸡明白捕鸟人的用意后，苦苦恳求捕鸟人饶命，说道：“如果你杀了我，以后怎么知道夜里的时间？</seg>
<seg id="1728">and who will wake you up in the morning when it is time to get to work?"</seg>
<seg id="1728">谁在早上到点唤醒你去干活？”</seg>
<seg id="1729">The Fowler, however, replied, "You are useful for telling the time, I know;</seg>
<seg id="1729">捕鸟人却回答：“我知道，你告诉我时间是很有用，</seg>
<seg id="1730">but, for all that, I can't send my friend supperless to bed."</seg>
<seg id="1730">但尽管如此，我不能让我的朋友没吃晚饭就睡觉。”</seg>
<seg id="1731">And therewith he caught him and wrung his neck.</seg>
<seg id="1731">于是，捕鸟人抓住公鸡，扭断了它的脖子。</seg>
<seg id="1732">THE GNAT AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1732">蚊子和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1733">A Gnat once went up to a Lion and said, "I am not in the least afraid of you:</seg>
<seg id="1733">有一次，蚊子飞到狮子面前，说：“我一点儿不怕你，</seg>
<seg id="1734">I don't even allow that you are a match for me in strength.</seg>
<seg id="1734">我甚至不认为你比我强大多少。</seg>
<seg id="1735">What does your strength amount to after all?</seg>
<seg id="1735">你的能耐究竟有多厉害？</seg>
<seg id="1736">That you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth--just like a woman in a temper--and nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="1736">你会用爪子去抓，用牙齿去咬——就像女人的脾气一样——没什么大不了的。</seg>
<seg id="1737">But I'm stronger than you:</seg>
<seg id="1737">而我比你强多了，</seg>
<seg id="1738">if you don't believe it, let us fight and see."</seg>
<seg id="1738">如果你不信，我们来比比看。”</seg>
<seg id="1739">So saying, the Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1739">说完，蚊子把触角一点点伸进狮子的鼻子里，</seg>
<seg id="1740">When the Lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its victory.</seg>
<seg id="1740">狮子感到刺痛，急忙去压死它，蚊子却把狮子的鼻子抓得更厉害了，甚至抓出血来，而狮子完全没有伤到蚊子，蚊子取得了胜利而洋洋得意，“嗡嗡”地唱着凯歌飞走了。</seg>
<seg id="1741">Presently, however, it got entangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed over the King of the Beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1741">然而，没过多久，蚊子就落入了蛛网中，被一只蜘蛛逮住吃掉了。在战胜百兽之王后，其下场不过是沦为一只毫不起眼的昆虫的食物。</seg>
<seg id="1742">THE FARMER AND HIS DOGS</seg>
<seg id="1742">农夫和狗</seg>
<seg id="1743">A Farmer was snowed up in his farmstead by a severe storm, and was unable to go out and procure provisions for himself and his family.</seg>
<seg id="1743">农夫被一场狂风暴雪困在农场里，无法出去为一家人寻找食物。</seg>
<seg id="1744">So he first killed his sheep and used them for food;</seg>
<seg id="1744">于是，他先宰了绵羊来充饥。</seg>
<seg id="1745">then, as the storm still continued, he killed his goats;</seg>
<seg id="1745">由于当时暴风雨一直下个不停，他又宰了山羊。</seg>
<seg id="1746">and, last of all, as the weather showed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and eat them.</seg>
<seg id="1746">最后，由于天气还没有转好的迹象，他不得已宰了牛来果腹。</seg>
<seg id="1747">When his Dogs saw the various animals being killed and eaten in turn, they said to one another, "We had better get out of this or we shall be the next to go!"</seg>
<seg id="1747">他的狗儿们看到各种动物都被一一宰杀吃掉了，就窃窃私议：“我们最好离开这里，否则，接下来将轮到我们被宰了！”</seg>
<seg id="1748">THE EAGLE AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1748">鹰和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1749">An Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near one another:</seg>
<seg id="1749">鹰和狐狸成了好朋友，决定要相互住得近一点，</seg>
<seg id="1750">they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be.</seg>
<seg id="1750">它们想彼此多见面，友情就会更深。</seg>
<seg id="1751">So the Eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs.</seg>
<seg id="1751">于是，鹰在一棵大树的顶部筑了巢，与此同时，狐狸在树下的灌木丛中安了家，还生了一窝小狐狸。</seg>
<seg id="1752">One day the Fox went out foraging for food, and the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family.</seg>
<seg id="1752">有一天，狐狸出去找食物，鹰也想为自己的孩子找点吃的，就飞到灌木丛中，抓起狐狸的幼崽，飞回树上喂饱自己和家人。</seg>
<seg id="1753">When the Fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her out for her treachery.</seg>
<seg id="1753">当狐狸回来发现了这件事，它不仅为失去孩子感到非常伤心，更为自己不能逮到鹰为孩子们报仇而十分气恼。</seg>
<seg id="1754">So she sat down not far off and cursed her.</seg>
<seg id="1754">狐狸只好坐在不远处咒骂鹰。</seg>
<seg id="1755">But it wasn't long before she had her revenge.</seg>
<seg id="1755">但没过多久，报仇的机会来了。</seg>
<seg id="1756">Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest.</seg>
<seg id="1756">一些村民正巧在附近的祭坛上以一头羊作祭祀，鹰飞下来叼了一块烧着的羊肉回到巢里。</seg>
<seg id="1757">There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1757">一阵大风刮来，鹰巢着火了，雏鹰被烧死掉到了地上。</seg>
<seg id="1758">Then the Fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.</seg>
<seg id="1758">狐狸就跑到那儿，让鹰眼睁睁地看着自己把这些雏鹰狼吞虎咽地吃了。</seg>
<seg id="1759">False faith may escape human punishment, but cannot escape the divine.</seg>
<seg id="1759">背信弃义可能会逃过法律的惩罚，但无法逃避天谴。</seg>
<seg id="1760">THE BUTCHER AND HIS CUSTOMERS</seg>
<seg id="1760">屠夫与顾客</seg>
<seg id="1761">Two Men were buying meat at a Butcher's stall in the market-place, and, while the Butcher's back was turned for a moment, one of them snatched up a joint and hastily thrust it under the other's cloak, where it could not be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1761">有两个人到市场上的一家肉摊上去买肉，他们趁着屠夫转过身去的那一会儿工夫，其中一人突然拿了一块肉慌忙塞到另一个人的外套下，这样别人就发现不了。</seg>
<seg id="1762">When the Butcher turned round, he missed the meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it:</seg>
<seg id="1762">当屠夫回过身来，立刻发现丢失了一块肉，便指责他们偷窃。</seg>
<seg id="1763">but the one who had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it said he hadn't taken it.</seg>
<seg id="1763">但从肉摊上偷肉的那人说，他没有那块肉；而另一个藏有肉的人说，他没有去偷那块肉。</seg>
<seg id="1764">The Butcher felt sure they were deceiving him, but he only said, "You may cheat me with your lying, but you can't cheat the gods, and they won't let you off so lightly."</seg>
<seg id="1764">屠夫确信他俩在骗人，但他只是说：“你们可以撒谎骗我，但你们骗不了神灵，他们不会这么轻易放过你们。”</seg>
<seg id="1765">Prevarication often amounts to perjury.</seg>
<seg id="1765">含糊其辞等同于做伪证。</seg>
<seg id="1766">HERCULES AND MINERVA</seg>
<seg id="1766">赫拉克勒斯和密涅瓦</seg>
<seg id="1767">Hercules was once travelling along a narrow road when he saw lying on the ground in front of him what appeared to be an apple, and as he passed he stamped upon it with his heel.</seg>
<seg id="1767">有一次，赫拉克勒斯沿着一条狭窄的公路行走，他看到前面的地上有一个像苹果一样的物体，他就过去用脚踩在上面。</seg>
<seg id="1768">To his astonishment, instead of being crushed it doubled in size;</seg>
<seg id="1768">令他惊讶的是，他踩上去后，物体的尺寸大了一倍，</seg>
<seg id="1769">and, on his attacking it again and smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and blocked up the whole road.</seg>
<seg id="1769">于是他再去碰那个物体，用棍子重重地敲击，只见那物体越长越大，把整条路都堵塞了。</seg>
<seg id="1770">Upon this he dropped his club, and stood looking at it in amazement.</seg>
<seg id="1770">他只好扔下棍子，站在那里盯着物体发愣。</seg>
<seg id="1771">Just then Minerva appeared, and said to him, "Leave it alone, my friend;</seg>
<seg id="1771">正在这时，密涅瓦出现了，对他说：“别去碰它，朋友。</seg>
<seg id="1772">that which you see before you is the apple of discord:</seg>
<seg id="1772">你所看到的在你面前的那个东西是不和的种子，</seg>
<seg id="1773">if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it was at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing you see."</seg>
<seg id="1773">如果你不去乱动它，它仍然像原来那样，但如果你去招惹它，它就变成你看到的那个样子。”</seg>
<seg id="1774">THE FOX WHO SERVED A LION</seg>
<seg id="1774">为狮子服务的狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1775">A Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the Fox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions.</seg>
<seg id="1775">狮子有狐狸伺候它，每当它们去打猎，都由狐狸先找到猎物，狮子再扑上去猎杀，然后它们将猎物分成几份。</seg>
<seg id="1776">But the Lion always got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all;</seg>
<seg id="1776">但狮子总是拿得比较多，狐狸只能得到很小的一份，这让狐狸很不高兴，</seg>
<seg id="1777">so he determined to set up on his own account.</seg>
<seg id="1777">它决定自立门户。</seg>
<seg id="1778">He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him.</seg>
<seg id="1778">狐狸企图从羊群中偷一只小羊羔，但牧羊人发现了狐狸，便放狗去追它。</seg>
<seg id="1779">The hunter was now the hunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1779">狐狸这个捕猎者现在却成了被捕者，很快被一群狗捕杀了。</seg>
<seg id="1780">Better servitude with safety than freedom with danger.</seg>
<seg id="1780">安全环境下的奴役胜过危险环境下的自由。</seg>
<seg id="1781">THE QUACK DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1781">庸医</seg>
<seg id="1782">A certain man fell sick and took to his bed.</seg>
<seg id="1782">有一个人感觉身体不舒服，就卧床休息。</seg>
<seg id="1783">He consulted a number of doctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him that his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would probably last a considerable time.</seg>
<seg id="1783">他找了许多医生来看，除了一个医生以外，其他医生都告诉他，目前不会有危险，但他的病恢复起来可能需要一段时间。</seg>
<seg id="1784">The one who took a different view of his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare for the worst:</seg>
<seg id="1784">只有一个医生对他的病情给出了不同的观点，建议他对病情要有最坏的思想准备。</seg>
<seg id="1785">"You have not twenty-four hours to live," said he, "and I fear I can do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1785">“你不会活过24小时，”那个医生说，“我恐怕什么也帮不了你。”</seg>
<seg id="1786">As it turned out, however, he was quite wrong;</seg>
<seg id="1786">可是，结果证明这个医生完全错了，</seg>
<seg id="1787">for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and took a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost.</seg>
<seg id="1787">因为几天后，病人能下床了，而且可以到户外散步，但他的面色真的看起来像死人一样苍白。</seg>
<seg id="1788">In the course of his walk he met the Doctor who had prophesied his death.</seg>
<seg id="1788">他在散步时，遇到了那个预言他要死的医生。</seg>
<seg id="1789">"Dear me," said the latter, "how do you do?</seg>
<seg id="1789">“哎呀，”医生说，“你好吗？</seg>
<seg id="1790">You are fresh from the other world, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1790">毫无疑问，你刚从另一个世界来吧。</seg>
<seg id="1791">Pray, how are our departed friends getting on there?"</seg>
<seg id="1791">我已经过世的朋友，你在那儿日子过得怎么样？”</seg>
<seg id="1792">"Most comfortably," replied the other, "for they have drunk the water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life.</seg>
<seg id="1792">“非常好，”病人回答，“因为他们喝了忘川水，忘记了生命中所有的烦恼。</seg>
<seg id="1793">By the way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements to prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in the course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive.</seg>
<seg id="1793">顺便说一下，就在我离开前，下届的统治者制定措施要对所有的医生提起公诉，因为医生把病人治死了，使其不能尽享天年。</seg>
<seg id="1794">They were going to charge you along with the rest, till I assured them that you were no doctor, but a mere impostor."</seg>
<seg id="1794">除了其他医生以外，下界的统治者还要控告你，直到我使他们相信你不是医生，只不过是一个江湖骗子。”</seg>
<seg id="1795">THE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1795">狮子、狼和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1796">A Lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the Fox.</seg>
<seg id="1796">一头年老体弱的狮子病倒在洞穴里，除了狐狸之外，森林里所有的野兽都前来问候它的健康。</seg>
<seg id="1797">The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."</seg>
<seg id="1797">狼心想，这是一个好机会，可以趁此对它的仇敌狐狸进行报复，于是它提醒狮子注意狐狸没来。它说：“陛下，您看，我们都来探望您的病情，除了狐狸，只有它没来看您，它不关心您的病情是好还是坏。”</seg>
<seg id="1798">Just then the Fox came in and heard the last words of the Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="1798">正在这时，狐狸过来了，听到了狼说的最后几句话。</seg>
<seg id="1799">The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."</seg>
<seg id="1799">狮子对狐狸大发雷霆，狐狸恳求狮子允许它解释没到的原因。狐狸说：“陛下，它们没有一个像我这样对你如此关心，因为之前我在到处寻医问药，设法找到为您治病的药方。”</seg>
<seg id="1800">"And may I ask if you have found one?" said the Lion.</seg>
<seg id="1800">“那么，我能问你找到药方了吗？”狮子说。</seg>
<seg id="1801">"I have, sire," said the Fox, "and it is this: you must flay a Wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."</seg>
<seg id="1801">“陛下，我找到了。”狐狸说，“这治疗的方法是：您必须活剥一只狼的皮，将它的皮趁热敷在您的身上。”</seg>
<seg id="1802">The Lion accordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription;</seg>
<seg id="1802">狮子于是转过来对着狼，为了试用狐狸的药方，一掌把狼打死了。</seg>
<seg id="1803">but the Fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comes of stirring up ill-will."</seg>
<seg id="1803">狐狸笑着对狼说：“这就是引起别人恶念的后果。”</seg>
<seg id="1804">HERCULES AND PLUTUS</seg>
<seg id="1804">赫拉克勒斯和普路托斯</seg>
<seg id="1805">When Hercules was received among the gods and was entertained at a banquet by Jupiter, he responded courteously to the greetings of all with the exception of Plutus, the god of wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1805">赫拉克勒斯晋升为神以后，朱庇特设宴款待他，除了财神普路托斯以外，他对所有的神都致以亲切的问候。</seg>
<seg id="1806">When Plutus approached him, he cast his eyes upon the ground, and turned away and pretended not to see him.</seg>
<seg id="1806">当普路托斯走近他时，他眼睛盯着地面，转过身去假装没有看见。</seg>
<seg id="1807">Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his part, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other gods, he had behaved like that to Plutus.</seg>
<seg id="1807">朱庇特对他的这一行为感到很惊讶，问他为什么对其他所有的神都那么热情，唯独对普路托斯那样。</seg>
<seg id="1808">"Sire," said Hercules, "I do not like Plutus, and I will tell you why.</seg>
<seg id="1808">“陛下，”赫拉克勒斯说，“我不喜欢普路托斯，我会告诉你原因。</seg>
<seg id="1809">When we were on earth together I always noticed that he was to be found in the company of scoundrels."</seg>
<seg id="1809">当我们一起在人间时，我总是看到他与坏蛋混在一起。”</seg>

<seg id="1811">A Fox and a Leopard were disputing about their looks, and each claimed to be the more handsome of the two.</seg>
<seg id="1811">狐狸和豹就它俩哪个长得好看发生了争论，各自都声称自己比对方更漂亮。</seg>

<seg id="1812">豹说：“瞧我这身华丽的外衣，你根本比不上的。”</seg>
<seg id="1813">But the Fox replied, "Your coat may be smart, but my wits are smarter still."</seg>
<seg id="1813">然而，狐狸回答说：“你的外衣或许很华丽，但我的脑袋比你更聪明。”</seg>
<seg id="1814">THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG</seg>
<seg id="1814">狐狸和刺猬</seg>
<seg id="1815">A Fox, in swimming across a rapid river, was swept away by the current and carried a long way downstream in spite of his struggles, until at last, bruised and exhausted, he managed to scramble on to dry ground from a backwater.</seg>
<seg id="1815">一只狐狸经过一条湍急的河流时，被水流冲走了，尽管奋力挣扎，还是顺势被冲得很远。它伤痕累累、疲惫不堪。最后，狐狸想尽办法逆水而上，爬到一处干燥的地方。</seg>
<seg id="1816">As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of horseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was too weak even to shake them off.</seg>
<seg id="1816">它倒在那儿不能动弹，一群马蝇停在它的身上，毫无顾忌地吸它的血。可狐狸太虚弱了，无法赶走那群马蝇。</seg>
<seg id="1817">A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him;</seg>
<seg id="1817">一只刺猬看见了它，问它是否要对付那些令它讨厌的马蝇，</seg>
<seg id="1818">but the Fox replied, "Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now;</seg>
<seg id="1818">但狐狸回答说：“噢，不，请千万不要这么做，因为这些马蝇已经填饱了肚子，它们现在只吸一点点血了，</seg>
<seg id="1819">but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins."</seg>
<seg id="1819">但假如你赶走了它们，另外一群饥饿的马蝇就会飞过来，把我剩下的血都吸光，那我的血管里就一滴血都不剩了。”</seg>
<seg id="1820">THE CROW AND THE RAVEN</seg>
<seg id="1820">乌鸦和渡鸦</seg>
<seg id="1821">A Crow became very jealous of a Raven, because the latter was regarded by men as a bird of omen which foretold the future, and was accordingly held in great respect by them.</seg>

<seg id="1824">The travellers were in some dismay at the sound, for they feared it might be a bad omen;</seg>
<seg id="1824">行人听到乌鸦的叫声感到有点沮丧，因为他们担心这可能是不祥的预兆，</seg>
<seg id="1825">till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, "It's all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that means nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1825">直到其中一人发现了乌鸦，对他的同伴们说：“没关系，朋友们，我们别再害怕了，那不过是一只乌鸦，没什么大不了的。”</seg>

<seg id="1836">He had a long way to go, and was tired out before he had got much more than half-way.</seg>
<seg id="1836">他要走很长的一段路，还没走到一半路程时，就已经筋疲力尽了。</seg>
<seg id="1837">Casting his burden on the ground, he called upon Death to come and release him from his life of toil.</seg>
<seg id="1837">他把柴担扔到地上，唤来死神，请死神把他从苦命的境况中解脱出来。</seg>
<seg id="1838">The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him.</seg>
<seg id="1838">话刚出口，他就气馁了。死神站在他面前，准备为他服务。</seg>
<seg id="1839">He was almost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out, "Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help me up with my burden again."</seg>
<seg id="1839">他吓得要命，但强装镇定，结结巴巴地说：“尊敬的先生，如果你好心的话，请帮忙把柴担再放到我的肩上。”</seg>
<seg id="1840">THE MISER</seg>
<seg id="1840">守财奴</seg>
<seg id="1841">A Miser sold everything he had, and melted down his hoard of gold into a single lump, which he buried secretly in a field.</seg>
<seg id="1841">一个守财奴变卖了他所有的东西，换成一块金子，秘密地藏在一个地方。</seg>
<seg id="1842">Every day he went to look at it, and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his treasure.</seg>
<seg id="1842">每天他都要去那里看一看，有时要花好长时间得意地盯着他的金银财宝。</seg>
<seg id="1843">One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot, and one day watched him and discovered his secret.</seg>
<seg id="1843">他手下有个仆人，注意到他经常去那个地方，有一天就观察他，发现了他的秘密。</seg>
<seg id="1844">Waiting his opportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it.</seg>
<seg id="1844">一天晚上，仆人逮到机会去了那里，找到金子，并偷走了。</seg>
<seg id="1845">Next day the Miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure gone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss.</seg>
<seg id="1845">第二天，守财奴像往常一样去那里，发现他的金子不见了，立刻伤心得捶胸顿足、喃喃抱怨。</seg>
<seg id="1846">In this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what his trouble was.</seg>
<seg id="1846">有位邻居看到他这个样子，就问他为何烦恼。</seg>
<seg id="1847">The Miser told him of his misfortune;</seg>
<seg id="1847">守财奴告诉了他自己的不幸。</seg>
<seg id="1848">but the other replied, "Don't take it so much to heart, my friend;</seg>
<seg id="1848">然而邻居回答说：“朋友，别太往心里去。</seg>
<seg id="1849">put a brick into the hole, and take a look at it every day:</seg>
<seg id="1849">拿块砖放在洞里，每天看一看，</seg>
<seg id="1850">you won't be any worse off than before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you."</seg>
<seg id="1850">你不会觉得和以前有什么差别，因为即使你有金块的时候，那金块对你来说也没用。”</seg>
<seg id="1851">THE HORSE AND THE STAG</seg>
<seg id="1851">马和鹿</seg>
<seg id="1852">There was once a Horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all to himself.</seg>
<seg id="1852">从前，马经常在自己独占的一片草地上吃草。</seg>
<seg id="1853">But one day a Stag came into the meadow, and said he had as good a right to feed there as the Horse, and moreover chose all the best places for himself.</seg>
<seg id="1853">但有一天，一头鹿来到了这片草地上，说自己有权和马一样在那儿吃草，而且还为自己选了一处最好的地方。</seg>
<seg id="1854">The Horse, wishing to be revenged upon his unwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the Stag.</seg>
<seg id="1854">马想要报复这个讨厌的不速之客，就去找人，请他帮自己赶走这头鹿。</seg>
<seg id="1855">"Yes," said the man, "I will by all means; but I can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back."</seg>
<seg id="1855">“好的，”那人说，“我会尽一切办法帮你的，如果你能让我在你嘴上安一个马缰，并让我骑在你的背上。”</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Horse agreed to this, and the two together very soon turned the Stag out of the pasture:</seg>
<seg id="1856">马同意了这个要求，他俩一起很快把鹿从草地上赶了出去。</seg>
<seg id="1857">but when that was done, the Horse found to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good.</seg>
<seg id="1857">但此后，马发现，令它沮丧的是，因为这点利益，自己已经被人给控制了。</seg>
<seg id="1858">THE FOX AND THE BRAMBLE</seg>
<seg id="1858">狐狸和荆棘</seg>
<seg id="1859">In making his way through a hedge a Fox missed his footing and caught at a Bramble to save himself from falling.</seg>
<seg id="1859">狐狸翻越一道篱笆，却踩空了，只好抓住一棵荆棘来不让自己掉下去。</seg>
<seg id="1860">Naturally, he got badly scratched, and in disgust he cried to the Bramble, "It was your help I wanted, and see how you have treated me!</seg>
<seg id="1860">显然，狐狸被严重刺伤了，它懊恼地对荆棘喊道：“我向你求助，瞧你是怎样对我的！</seg>
<seg id="1861">I'd sooner have fallen outright."</seg>
<seg id="1861">我宁愿当即掉下去。”</seg>
<seg id="1862">The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, "You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at others."</seg>
<seg id="1862">荆棘打断了狐狸的话，回答说：“我自己总是绊住别人，而你却来绊我，朋友，你一定是昏了头。”</seg>
<seg id="1863">THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG</seg>
<seg id="1863">狮子、狐狸和雄鹿</seg>
<seg id="1864">A Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food.</seg>
<seg id="1864">狮子病倒在洞里，不能去觅食了。</seg>
<seg id="1865">So he said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, "My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag, who lives there, to come to my den:</seg>
<seg id="1865">于是，狮子对前来慰问的朋友狐狸说：“好朋友，我希望你去那边的树林，把住在那里的大雄鹿骗到我的洞里来，</seg>
<seg id="1866">I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains."</seg>
<seg id="1866">我想用鹿的心和脑当晚餐。”</seg>
<seg id="1867">The Fox went to the wood and found the Stag and said to him, "My dear sir, you're in luck.</seg>
<seg id="1867">狐狸去了树林，找到雄鹿，对它说：“亲爱的先生，你交运了。</seg>
<seg id="1868">You know the Lion, our King:</seg>
<seg id="1868">你知道我们的百兽之王狮子，</seg>
<seg id="1869">well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1869">它快要死了，它提出你作为它的继承者统领百兽。</seg>
<seg id="1870">I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news.</seg>
<seg id="1870">我希望你不要忘记，我是第一个带给你这个好消息的。</seg>
<seg id="1871">And now I must be going back to him;</seg>
<seg id="1871">现在，我必须回到狮子那儿，</seg>
<seg id="1872">and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last."</seg>
<seg id="1872">假如你接受我的建议，你也在狮子临终前过来一下吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1873">The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1873">雄鹿非常高兴，毫不怀疑地跟着狐狸去了狮子的洞穴。</seg>
<seg id="1874">No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood.</seg>
<seg id="1874">当它一进洞里，狮子就猛地扑过来，可是它力不从心，只伤到了雄鹿的耳朵，雄鹿飞快地逃回了树林深处。</seg>
<seg id="1875">The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness.</seg>
<seg id="1875">狐狸非常沮丧，狮子也极为失望，因为虽然它病倒了，但仍饥饿难耐。</seg>
<seg id="1876">So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing the Stag to his den.</seg>
<seg id="1876">于是，狮子央求狐狸另行设法，再试着把雄鹿骗到洞里来。</seg>
<seg id="1877">"It'll be almost impossible this time," said the Fox, "but I'll try";</seg>
<seg id="1877">“这几乎很难办到，”狐狸说，“但我试试看。”</seg>
<seg id="1878">and off he went to the wood a second time, and found the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright.</seg>
<seg id="1878">狐狸又去了树林，发现雄鹿在静静地休养，试着从惊恐中恢复过来。</seg>
<seg id="1879">As soon as he saw the Fox he cried, "You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that?</seg>
<seg id="1879">不久，雄鹿看到了狐狸，大声喝道：“你这混蛋，你像这样诱骗我去送死，打的是什么主意？</seg>
<seg id="1880">Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns."</seg>
<seg id="1880">你滚开，否则我用鹿角捅死你。”</seg>
<seg id="1881">But the Fox was entirely shameless.</seg>
<seg id="1881">但狐狸完全不知羞耻。</seg>
<seg id="1882">"What a coward you were," said he; "surely you didn't think the Lion meant any harm?</seg>
<seg id="1882">“你太懦弱胆小了，”狐狸说，“你肯定想不到狮子对你到底有什么用意。</seg>
<seg id="1883">Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="1883">因为它只想悄悄对着你的耳朵说一些国家机密，而你却像一只受惊的兔子一样逃跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1884">You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit.</seg>
<seg id="1884">你会有点讨厌它，我不确定它是否愿意立狼为王，除非你马上回去，表明你的态度。</seg>
<seg id="1885">I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant."</seg>
<seg id="1885">我答应你，它不会伤害你，而我将是你忠实的仆人。”</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made no mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his carcase.</seg>
<seg id="1886">愚蠢的雄鹿完全被狐狸说服，又回到狮子的洞穴，这次狮子没有失手，一下击倒了雄鹿，好好地享用了一顿美餐。</seg>
<seg id="1887">The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble.</seg>
<seg id="1887">此时，狐狸也瞅准机会，趁狮子不注意时，偷走了雄鹿的脑髓，算是对自己所作努力的奖励。</seg>
<seg id="1888">Presently the Lion began searching for them, of course without success:</seg>
<seg id="1888">不一会儿，狮子开始寻找雄鹿的脑髓，当然没有找到。</seg>
<seg id="1889">and the Fox, who was watching him, said, "I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains:</seg>
<seg id="1889">狐狸看着狮子说：“我不认为你寻找雄鹿的脑髓对你有多大的用处，</seg>
<seg id="1890">a creature who twice walked into a Lion's den can't have got any."</seg>
<seg id="1890">这种两次踏进狮子洞的家伙不会有什么脑子的。”</seg>
<seg id="1891">THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER</seg>
<seg id="1891">鹧鸪和捕鸟者</seg>
<seg id="1892">A Fowler caught a Partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said, "Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets."</seg>
<seg id="1892">捕鸟者在网里逮到了一只鹧鸪，正要扭断它的脖子时，鹧鸪可怜兮兮地恳求捕鸟者放它一命，“不要杀我，给我留一条生路，我会引诱其他鹧鸪到你的网里来，以报答你对我的仁慈。”</seg>
<seg id="1893">"No," said the Fowler, "I will not spare you.</seg>
<seg id="1893">“不行，”捕鸟者说，“我决不能放过你。</seg>
<seg id="1894">I was going to kill you anyhow, and after that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate."</seg>
<seg id="1894">我无论如何都要杀了你，因为你骗人的言行，完全命该如此。”</seg>
<seg id="1895">THE HUNTER AND THE WOODMAN</seg>
<seg id="1895">猎人和樵夫</seg>
<seg id="1896">A Hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and, catching sight presently of a Woodman engaged in felling a tree, he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints anywhere about, or if he knew where his den was.</seg>
<seg id="1896">一位猎人在森林里寻找狮子的踪迹，突然看见一位樵夫正在伐木，他就走过去问樵夫，是否在哪儿见过狮子的脚印，或者是否知道狮子的洞穴在哪里。</seg>
<seg id="1897">The Woodman answered, "If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself."</seg>
<seg id="1897">樵夫回答：“如果你愿意跟我来，我将带你去见狮子。”</seg>
<seg id="1898">The Hunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied, "Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1898">猎人害怕得脸色煞白，颤抖地答道：“噢，谢谢，我不是要找狮子，只是为了找它的踪迹。”</seg>
<seg id="1899">THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE</seg>
<seg id="1899">蛇和鹰</seg>
<seg id="1900">An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it.</seg>
<seg id="1900">一只鹰向一条蛇猛地俯冲下来，用爪子一把抓住蛇，打算把它掠走并一口吞了。</seg>
<seg id="1901">But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment;</seg>
<seg id="1901">然而，蛇的动作太快了，立刻用身体把鹰给缠住了，</seg>
<seg id="1902">and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two.</seg>
<seg id="1902">接着它俩发生了一场生死搏斗。</seg>
<seg id="1903">A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1903">一位村民偶然看到了这一幕，就过来帮助鹰，让鹰从蛇的缠绕中成功逃脱。</seg>
<seg id="1904">In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn.</seg>
<seg id="1904">蛇为了报复，就往那人的水壶里吐了几口毒液。</seg>
<seg id="1905">Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1905">村民因刚才用了力，觉得很热，便拿起水壶想喝口水解渴，正在这时，鹰撞落了村民手中的水壶，壶中的水全都洒落到了地面上。</seg>
<seg id="1906">One good turn deserves another.</seg>
<seg id="1906">善有善报。</seg>
<seg id="1907">THE HORSE AND THE ASS</seg>
<seg id="1907">马和驴</seg>
<seg id="1908">A Horse, proud of his fine harness, met an Ass on the high-road.</seg>
<seg id="1908">一匹马为自己拥有精美的马具而洋洋得意，这天它在公路上正好遇见了一头驴。</seg>
<seg id="1909">As the Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster.</seg>
<seg id="1909">驴载着沉重的货物慢慢地从马身边经过，马不耐烦地对驴大声说，它几乎忍不住要撞到驴，让驴快快离开。</seg>
<seg id="1910">The Ass held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence.</seg>
<seg id="1910">驴默不作声，但无法不在意马的傲慢。</seg>
<seg id="1911">Not long afterwards the Horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer.</seg>
<seg id="1911">没过多久，马患了气喘，被主人卖给了一个农夫。</seg>
<seg id="1912">One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him and said, "Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud!</seg>
<seg id="1912">一天，当马正在拉一辆粪车时，又遇到了驴，这次轮到驴嘲笑它了：“啊哈！你从没想过来这里吧，瞧你，你是如此骄傲！</seg>
<seg id="1913">Where are all your gay trappings now?"</seg>
<seg id="1913">如今你那漂亮的马具都到哪儿去了？”</seg>
<seg id="1914">THE HAWK, THE KITE, AND THE PIGEONS</seg>
<seg id="1914">鹰、鸢和鸽子</seg>
<seg id="1915">The Pigeons in a certain dovecote were persecuted by a Kite, who every now and then swooped down and carried off one of their number.</seg>
<seg id="1915">鸽笼里的鸽子们受到一只鸢的侵袭，鸢每次突然俯冲下来都会掠走其中一只鸽子。</seg>
<seg id="1916">So they invited a Hawk into the dovecote to defend them against their enemy.</seg>
<seg id="1916">于是，鸽子们请鹰到鸽笼里来保护它们，帮它们对抗敌人。</seg>
<seg id="1917">But they soon repented of their folly:</seg>
<seg id="1917">但它们很快对自己的愚蠢行为感到懊悔了，</seg>
<seg id="1918">for the Hawk killed more of them in a day than the Kite had done in a year.</seg>
<seg id="1918">因为鹰一天掠杀它们的数量比鸢一年掠杀的还要多。</seg>
<seg id="1919">PROMETHEUS AND THE MAKING OF MAN</seg>
<seg id="1919">普罗米修斯和造人</seg>
<seg id="1920">At the bidding of Jupiter, Prometheus set about the creation of Man and the other animals.</seg>
<seg id="1920">奉朱庇特之命，普罗米修斯开始创造人和其他动物。</seg>
<seg id="1921">Jupiter, seeing that Mankind, the only rational creatures, were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts, bade him redress the balance by turning some of the latter into men.</seg>
<seg id="1921">朱庇特发现，只有人类是理性的，而不理性的野兽的数量远比人类要多，就命令普罗米修斯把一些野兽改造成人，从而来达到平衡。</seg>
<seg id="1922">Prometheus did as he was bidden, and this is the reason why some people have the forms of men but the souls of beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1922">普罗米修斯遵命行事，这就是有些人人面兽心的原因。</seg>
<seg id="1923">THE SWALLOW AND THE CROW</seg>
<seg id="1923">燕子和乌鸦</seg>
<seg id="1924">A Swallow was once boasting to a Crow about her birth.</seg>
<seg id="1924">有一次，燕子对乌鸦吹嘘自己的出身。</seg>
<seg id="1925">"I was once a princess," said she, "the daughter of a King of Athens, but my husband used me cruelly, and cut out my tongue for a slight fault.</seg>
<seg id="1925">“我曾经是一位公主，”燕子说，“我是雅典国王的女儿，但我的丈夫对我非常残忍，因为一些细小的缺点割了我的舌头。</seg>
<seg id="1926">Then, to protect me from further injury, I was turned by Juno into a bird."</seg>
<seg id="1926">于是，为了保护我免受更多的伤害，朱诺就把我变成了一只鸟。”</seg>
<seg id="1927">"You chatter quite enough as it is," said the Crow.</seg>
<seg id="1927">“事实上，你太啰唆了，”乌鸦说，</seg>
<seg id="1928">"What you would have been like if you hadn't lost your tongue, I can't think."</seg>
<seg id="1928">“我无法想象，假如你没有失去舌头，你将会是什么样子。”</seg>
<seg id="1929">THE HUNTER AND THE HORSEMAN</seg>
<seg id="1929">猎人和骑手</seg>
<seg id="1930">A Hunter went out after game, and succeeded in catching a hare, which he was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback, who said to him, "You have had some sport I see, sir," and offered to buy it.</seg>
<seg id="1930">猎人出去打猎，成功逮到了一只野兔。他带着野兔回家时，遇到了一位骑手，那人对他说：“先生，看来你满载而归啊。”并表示想要买这只野兔。</seg>
<seg id="1931">The Hunter readily agreed;</seg>
<seg id="1931">猎人高兴地答应了，</seg>
<seg id="1932">but the Horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop.</seg>
<seg id="1932">而那个骑手一把野兔拿到手就扬鞭策马飞奔而去。</seg>
<seg id="1933">The Hunter ran after him for some little distance;</seg>
<seg id="1933">猎人在他身后追了一小段路，</seg>
<seg id="1934">but it soon dawned upon him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to overtake the Horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud as he could, "All right, sir, all right, take your hare:</seg>
<seg id="1934">但很快意识到自己被骗了。猎人放弃了对骑手的追赶，为了挽回面子，他对着骑手的背影大声喊道：“好吧，先生，把野兔拿去吧，</seg>
<seg id="1935">it was meant all along as a present."</seg>
<seg id="1935">就当是我送给你的礼物。”</seg>
<seg id="1936">THE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS</seg>
<seg id="1936">牧羊人和野山羊</seg>
<seg id="1937">A Goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number of Wild Goats approach and mingle with his flock.</seg>
<seg id="1937">牧羊人在牧场上放羊时，发现许多野山羊混杂在他的羊群中。</seg>
<seg id="1938">At the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together.</seg>
<seg id="1938">天晚了，他赶着羊群回家，把所有的羊都一起关入羊栏。</seg>
<seg id="1939">Next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual:</seg>
<seg id="1939">第二天，天气不好，牧羊人没有像往常一样带着羊群出去放牧，</seg>
<seg id="1940">so he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there.</seg>
<seg id="1940">于是在家里看护羊群，给它们喂食。</seg>
<seg id="1941">He only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the Wild Goats as much as they could eat and more;</seg>
<seg id="1941">他只给自己的山羊仅够果腹的食物，而给那些野山羊吃得饱饱的，</seg>
<seg id="1942">for he was very anxious for them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn't want to leave him.</seg>
<seg id="1942">因为他很想把野山羊留下来，牧羊人以为只要把那些野山羊喂饱喂好，它们就不想离开了。</seg>
<seg id="1943">When the weather improved, he took them all out to pasture again;</seg>
<seg id="1943">当天气转好，牧羊人又带着所有的羊出去放牧，</seg>
<seg id="1944">but no sooner had they got near the hills than the Wild Goats broke away from the flock and scampered off.</seg>
<seg id="1944">但一靠近山坡，野山羊就从羊群中突然窜出，飞快地跑掉了。</seg>
<seg id="1945">The Goatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for their ingratitude.</seg>
<seg id="1945">牧羊人对此非常懊恼，痛骂它们忘恩负义。</seg>
<seg id="1946">"Rascals!" he cried, "to run away like that after the way I've treated you!"</seg>
<seg id="1946">“坏家伙！”他大声地说，“我那样对你们，你们还是逃跑了！”</seg>
<seg id="1947">Hearing this, one of them turned round and said, "Oh, yes, you treated us all right--too well, in fact;</seg>
<seg id="1947">听了这话，其中一只野山羊回过头来说：“噢，是的，你对我们很好——</seg>
<seg id="1948">it was just that that put us on our guard. </seg>
<seg id="1948">确实非常好，这正是我们要警惕的原因。</seg>
<seg id="1949">If you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely that, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, we should then be neglected in favour of the last comers."</seg>
<seg id="1949">假如你对新来的羊也像对我们一样厚待，比对你自己的羊还要好，若其他的山羊加入到你的羊群中，那你就会偏向于后来者，而我们就会被忽视了。”</seg>
<seg id="1950">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE SWALLOW</seg>
<seg id="1950">夜莺和燕子</seg>
<seg id="1951">A Swallow, conversing with a Nightingale, advised her to quit the leafy coverts where she made her home, and to come and live with men, like herself, and nest under the shelter of their roofs.</seg>
<seg id="1951">燕子与夜莺聊天，劝它离开安置在枝繁叶茂的大树下的家，搬来和人一起住，像燕子一样，在屋檐下筑巢。</seg>
<seg id="1952">But the Nightingale replied, "Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among men:</seg>
<seg id="1952">但夜莺回答：“过去我也像你一样，和人生活在一起，</seg>
<seg id="1953">but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them hateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="1953">但却留下了痛苦的记忆，他们对我来说太可恨了，我再也不愿意靠近他们住的地方。”</seg>
