<seg id="3">THE FOX AND THE GRAPES</seg>
<seg id="3">狐狸和葡萄</seg>
<seg id="4">A hungry Fox saw some fine bunches of Grapes hanging from a vine that was trained along a high trellis, and did his best to reach them by jumping as high as he could into the air.</seg>
<seg id="4">一只饥肠辘辘的狐狸，看见缠绕在高架上的葡萄枝挂着几串成熟的葡萄，就尽力向上跳，想要摘下那些葡萄。但无论他怎么努力，也是徒劳无功，因为他始终够不着那些葡萄。</seg>
<seg id="5">But it was all in vain, for they were just out of reach: so he gave up trying, and walked away with an air of dignity and unconcern, remarking, "I thought those Grapes were ripe, but I see now they are quite sour."</seg>
<seg id="5">于是他放弃了，反而带着不屑一顾的样子走开了，边走边说：“还以为那些葡萄已经熟透了呢，现在看来根本就是酸葡萄。”</seg>
<seg id="6">THE GOOSE THAT LAID THE GOLDEN EGGS</seg>
<seg id="6">下金蛋的鹅</seg>
<seg id="7">A Man and his Wife had the good fortune to possess a Goose which laid a Golden Egg every day.</seg>
<seg id="7">有一对夫妇非常幸运，他们有一只每天下一枚金蛋的母鹅。</seg>
<seg id="8">Lucky though they were, they soon began to think they were not getting rich fast enough, and, imagining the bird must be made of gold inside, they decided to kill it in order to secure the whole store of precious metal at once.</seg>
<seg id="8">尽管非常幸运，可他们很快就觉着财富增加得还不够快，不仅如此，他们还以为这只鹅的内脏肯定也是金的。于是，他们决定杀掉它，这样就能立刻得到全部珍宝了。</seg>
<seg id="9">But when they cut it open they found it was just like any other goose.</seg>
<seg id="9">然而，他们把鹅开膛破肚之后，却发现和其它鹅没什么两样。</seg>
<seg id="10">Thus, they neither got rich all at once, as they had hoped, nor enjoyed any longer the daily addition to their wealth.</seg>
<seg id="10">如此，他们既没有像当初希望得那样一夜暴富，也不能再享有财富与日俱增的好运气了。</seg>
<seg id="11">Much wants more and loses all.</seg>
<seg id="11">贪多必失。</seg>
<seg id="12">THE CAT AND THE MICE</seg>
<seg id="12">猫和老鼠</seg>
<seg id="13">There was once a house that was overrun with Mice.</seg>
<seg id="13">从前，有一座房子，里面的老鼠泛滥成灾。</seg>
<seg id="14">A Cat heard of this, and said to herself, "That's the place for me," and off she went and took up her quarters in the house, and caught the Mice one by one and ate them.</seg>
<seg id="14">一只猫听到此事，便自言自语：“那正是我要去的地方。”于是她走到那座房子里住下来，一只接一只地抓老鼠，然后吃掉他们。</seg>
<seg id="15">At last the Mice could stand it no longer, and they determined to take to their holes and stay there.</seg>
<seg id="15">最后，老鼠们再也无法忍受下去，决定躲到自己的洞里，再也不出来。</seg>
<seg id="16">"That's awkward," said the Cat to herself: "the only thing to do is to coax them out by a trick."</seg>
<seg id="16">“这还真不好办了，”猫自言自语道，“若想骗他们出来，只能耍个花招了。”</seg>
<seg id="17">So she considered a while, and then climbed up the wall and let herself hang down by her hind legs from a peg, and pretended to be dead.</seg>
<seg id="17">她琢磨了一会儿，然后爬上墙，用后腿钩住木桩倒挂下来，假装已经死了。</seg>
<seg id="18">By and by a Mouse peeped out and saw the Cat hanging there.</seg>
<seg id="18">过了一会儿，一只老鼠向外窥探，看到了挂在那里的猫。</seg>
<seg id="19">"Aha!" it cried, "you're very clever, madam, no doubt:</seg>
<seg id="19">“啊哈！”老鼠大叫，“夫人，你还真聪明，</seg>
<seg id="20">but you may turn yourself into a bag of meal hanging there, if you like, yet you won't catch us coming anywhere near you."</seg>
<seg id="20">不过，就算你假装成一袋粮食挂在那里，你也骗不了我们去接近你。”</seg>
<seg id="21">If you are wise you won't be deceived by the innocent airs of those whom you have once found to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="21">如果有足够的智慧，面对那些曾认定的危险人物所假装出的无辜，你也不会上当受骗。</seg>
<seg id="22">THE MISCHIEVOUS DOG</seg>
<seg id="22">恶狗</seg>
<seg id="23">There was once a Dog who used to snap at people and bite them without any provocation, and who was a great nuisance to every one who came to his master's house.</seg>
<seg id="23">从前，有一条狗经常无缘无故地抓人、咬人，去他主人家做客的每个人都很讨厌他。</seg>
<seg id="24">So his master fastened a bell round his neck to warn people of his presence.</seg>
<seg id="24">主人在他的脖子上系了一个铃铛，以此提醒人们提防他的出现。</seg>
<seg id="25">The Dog was very proud of the bell, and strutted about tinkling it with immense satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="25">这条狗对脖子上戴着的铃铛引以为傲，大摇大摆地戴着它走来走去，十分满意这种叮当声。</seg>
<seg id="26">But an old dog came up to him and said, "The fewer airs you give yourself the better, my friend.</seg>
<seg id="26">但是，一条老狗却走过来对他说：“我的朋友，姿态越低，对你越好。</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't think, do you, that your bell was given you as a reward of merit?</seg>
<seg id="27">你不会真的以为这个铃铛是对你的奖赏吧？</seg>
<seg id="28">On the contrary, it is a badge of disgrace."</seg>
<seg id="28">事实恰恰相反，它是耻辱的标志呀。”</seg>
<seg id="29">Notoriety is often mistaken for fame.</seg>
<seg id="29">恶名常被误认为美誉。</seg>
<seg id="30">THE CHARCOAL-BURNER AND THE FULLER</seg>
<seg id="30">烧炭工和漂洗工</seg>
<seg id="31">There was once a Charcoal-burner who lived and worked by himself.</seg>
<seg id="31">从前，有一个自力更生的烧炭工人独自在家工作。</seg>
<seg id="32">A Fuller, however, happened to come and settle in the same neighbourhood;</seg>
<seg id="32">碰巧，一个漂洗工搬至隔壁，与他成了邻居。</seg>
<seg id="33">and the Charcoal-burner, having made his acquaintance and finding he was an agreeable sort of fellow, asked him if he would come and share his house:</seg>
<seg id="33">结识漂洗工后，烧炭工人经过了解发现，这个邻居将是一个很好的合作伙伴，就问漂洗工愿不愿意搬到他的铺子里一起工作。</seg>
<seg id="34">"We shall get to know one another better that way," he said, "and, beside, our household expenses will be diminished."</seg>
<seg id="34">“那样我们会变得更加亲密，”烧炭人说，“不仅如此，我们还可以节省生活开销呢。”</seg>
<seg id="35">The Fuller thanked him, but replied, "I couldn't think of it, sir:</seg>
<seg id="35">漂洗工却谢绝了他，回答说：“我可不这样看，先生，</seg>
<seg id="36">why, everything I take such pains to whiten would be blackened in no time by your charcoal."</seg>
<seg id="36">因为不管我把衣服漂洗得多么白，都会立刻被你的木炭染黑了。”</seg>
<seg id="37">THE MICE IN COUNCIL</seg>
<seg id="37">老鼠开会</seg>
<seg id="38">Once upon a time all the Mice met together in Council, and discussed the best means of securing themselves against the attacks of the cat.</seg>
<seg id="38">从前，所有的老鼠聚集在一起，开会商讨免受猫攻击的良策。</seg>
<seg id="39">After several suggestions had been debated, a Mouse of some standing and experience got up and said, "I think I have hit upon a plan which will ensure our safety in the future, provided you approve and carry it out.</seg>
<seg id="39">几个建议相继都被否决之后，一只很有威望且经验丰富的老鼠站起来，说：“我忽然想到一个办法，可以确保大家未来的安全，假如你们赞成的话，我们就这么办。</seg>
<seg id="40">It is that we should fasten a bell round the neck of our enemy the cat, which will by its tinkling warn us of her approach."</seg>
<seg id="40">这个办法是，我们应该在敌人的脖子上挂一个铃铛，猫走路时发出的叮当声，就会警告我们——猫要来了。”</seg>
<seg id="41">This proposal was warmly applauded, and it had been already decided to adopt it, when an old Mouse got upon his feet and said, "I agree with you all that the plan before us is an admirable one:</seg>
<seg id="41">他的提议受到了大家的赞同，都决定采用这个办法，就在这时，一只年长的老鼠伸出他的前爪，说：“我也赞同这是一个绝妙的好办法，</seg>
<seg id="42">but may I ask who is going to bell the cat?"</seg>
<seg id="42">但是，我想问一下，谁去给猫系铃铛呢？”</seg>
<seg id="43">THE BAT AND THE WEASELS</seg>
<seg id="43">蝙蝠和黄鼠狼</seg>
<seg id="44">A Bat fell to the ground and was caught by a Weasel, and was just going to be killed and eaten when it begged to be let go.</seg>
<seg id="44">蝙蝠落到地上，被黄鼠狼捉住了，就在快要被杀死、吃掉之前，他乞求黄鼠狼放了他。</seg>
<seg id="45">The Weasel said he couldn't do that because he was an enemy of all birds on principle.</seg>
<seg id="45">黄鼠狼说不能放了他，因为他向来是所有鸟类的敌人。</seg>
<seg id="46">"Oh, but," said the Bat, "I'm not a bird at all: I'm a mouse."</seg>
<seg id="46">蝙蝠说：“噢，我根本不是鸟儿，只不过是一只老鼠。”</seg>
<seg id="47">"So you are," said the Weasel, "now I come to look at you"; and he let it go.</seg>
<seg id="47">黄鼠狼说：“原来你是老鼠呀，现在我才看清你。”于是，黄鼠狼放走了蝙蝠。</seg>
<seg id="48">Some time after this the Bat was caught in just the same way by another Weasel, and, as before, begged for its life.</seg>
<seg id="48">不久，蝙蝠又以同样方式被另一只黄鼠狼捉住了，像从前那样，他又求黄鼠狼放了自己。</seg>
<seg id="49">"No," said the Weasel, "I never let a mouse go by any chance."</seg>
<seg id="49">“不行，”黄鼠狼说，“我绝不放过任何一只老鼠。”</seg>
<seg id="50">"But I'm not a mouse," said the Bat; "I'm a bird."</seg>
<seg id="50">“可我不是老鼠呀，”蝙蝠说，“我是一只鸟儿。”</seg>
<seg id="51">"Why, so you are," said the Weasel; and he too let the Bat go.</seg>
<seg id="51">“哎呀，原来你是一只鸟儿呀，”黄鼠狼说着，也放走了蝙蝠。</seg>
<seg id="52">Look and see which way the wind blows before you commit yourself.</seg>
<seg id="52">见风使舵。</seg>
<seg id="53">THE DOG AND THE SOW</seg>
<seg id="53">狗和母猪</seg>
<seg id="54">A Dog and a Sow were arguing and each claimed that its own young ones were finer than those of any other animal.</seg>
<seg id="54">狗和母猪争辩，都说自己的孩子更加出色。</seg>
<seg id="55">"Well," said the Sow at last, "mine can see, at any rate, when they come into the world:</seg>
<seg id="55">“嗯，”母猪最后说，“至少我的孩子一生下来就能看见东西，</seg>
<seg id="56">but yours are born blind."</seg>
<seg id="56">你的孩子生下来却是个瞎子。”</seg>
<seg id="57">THE FOX AND THE CROW</seg>
<seg id="57">狐狸和乌鸦</seg>
<seg id="58">A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese.</seg>
<seg id="58">乌鸦坐在树枝上，嘴里叼着一块奶酪。这时，狐狸在观察乌鸦，转动鬼脑筋想得到那块奶酪。</seg>
<seg id="59">Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, "What a noble bird I see above me!</seg>
<seg id="59">于是，狐狸走过去，站在树下，仰起头说道：“我的头上有一只多么高贵的鸟儿呀！</seg>
<seg id="60">Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite.</seg>
<seg id="60">她的美貌天下无双，她的羽毛精致纤美。</seg>
<seg id="61">If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."</seg>
<seg id="61">要是她的声音也像外貌和羽毛那样美好，毫无疑问，她真该成为鸟类的女王！”</seg>
<seg id="62">The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw.</seg>
<seg id="62">听到这番恭维，乌鸦简直受宠若惊，一心只想着向狐狸炫耀一下自己的歌喉，就“呱”地大叫了一声。</seg>
<seg id="63">Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, "You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."</seg>
<seg id="63">理所当然，她嘴里的那块奶酪就掉了下去，狐狸立刻抓起奶酪，说：“乌鸦夫人，我知道你的歌喉很不错，可你需要的是智慧。”</seg>
<seg id="64">THE HORSE AND THE GROOM</seg>
<seg id="64">马和马夫</seg>
<seg id="65">There was once a Groom who used to spend long hours clipping and combing the Horse of which he had charge, but who daily stole a portion of his allowance of oats, and sold it for his own profit.</seg>
<seg id="65">从前，有一个马夫，常常花费几个钟头来为他负责照管的马修剪和梳理毛发，可是他却每天都会偷一部分喂马的燕麦，拿去卖了以谋私利。</seg>
<seg id="66">The Horse gradually got into worse and worse condition, and at last cried to the Groom, "If you really want me to look sleek and well, you must comb me less and feed me more."</seg>
<seg id="66">逐渐地，马的健康状况越来越糟糕，最后忍不住对马夫大叫：“你要是真想让我看上去光滑闪亮，就应该少给我梳毛，多喂我燕麦。”</seg>
<seg id="67">THE WOLF AND THE LAMB</seg>
<seg id="67">狼和小羊</seg>
<seg id="68">A Wolf came upon a Lamb straying from the flock, and felt some compunction about taking the life of so helpless a creature without some plausible excuse;</seg>
<seg id="68">狼偶然碰见一只离群的小羊，似乎觉着平白无故杀死这么弱小无助的生命有点良心不安，</seg>
<seg id="69">so he cast about for a grievance and said at last, "Last year, sirrah, you grossly insulted me."</seg>
<seg id="69">于是他竭力寻找自己受过的各种委屈，最后说：“小子，去年你可是侮辱过我。”</seg>
<seg id="70">"That is impossible, sir," bleated the Lamb, "for I wasn't born then."</seg>
<seg id="70">“这不可能，先生。”小羊低声说，“那时，我还没出生呢。”</seg>
<seg id="71">"Well," retorted the Wolf, "you feed in my pastures."</seg>
<seg id="71">狼反驳道：“嗯，你在我的牧场里吃草来着。”</seg>
<seg id="72">"That cannot be," replied the Lamb, "for I have never yet tasted grass."</seg>
<seg id="72">“这更不可能啦，”小羊回答说，“我到现在还没尝过草的滋味呢。”</seg>
<seg id="73">"You drink from my spring, then," continued the Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="73">“那么，你喝过我的泉水。”狼继续编造借口。</seg>
<seg id="74">"Indeed, sir," said the poor Lamb, "I have never yet drunk anything but my mother's milk."</seg>
<seg id="74">“说实在的，先生，”可怜的小羊说，“除了妈妈的奶水，我从没喝过其它东西呢。”</seg>
<seg id="75">"Well, anyhow," said the Wolf, "I'm not going without my dinner":</seg>
<seg id="75">“好吧，不管怎么说，”狼说，“我总不能不吃晚饭。”</seg>
<seg id="76">and he sprang upon the Lamb and devoured it without more ado.</seg>
<seg id="76">于是，他扑向小羊，干脆痛快地把他吞了下去。</seg>
<seg id="77">THE PEACOCK AND THE CRANE</seg>
<seg id="77">孔雀与鹤</seg>
<seg id="78">A Peacock taunted a Crane with the dullness of her plumage.</seg>
<seg id="78">孔雀嘲讽鹤的羽毛色泽暗淡，</seg>
<seg id="79">"Look at my brilliant colours," said she, "and see how much finer they are than your poor feathers."</seg>
<seg id="79">她奚落道：“看看我的羽毛，多么鲜艳华丽呀，比你那灰暗难看的羽毛强出百倍。”</seg>
<seg id="80">"I am not denying," replied the Crane, "that yours are far gayer than mine;</seg>
<seg id="80">“我不否认，”鹤说道，“你的羽毛比我的华丽，</seg>
<seg id="81">but when it comes to flying I can soar into the clouds, whereas you are confined to the earth like any dunghill cock."</seg>
<seg id="81">可是，要说到飞行能力，我翅膀上的羽毛能在空中翱翔，而你却只能像公鸡一样，在地上行走。”</seg>
<seg id="82">THE CAT AND THE BIRDS</seg>
<seg id="82">猫和鸟</seg>
<seg id="83">A Cat heard that the Birds in an aviary were ailing.</seg>
<seg id="83">有一只猫，闻言某处鸟舍里的鸟儿们全都生病了。</seg>
<seg id="84">So he got himself up as a doctor, and, taking with him a set of the instruments proper to his profession, presented himself at the door, and inquired after the health of the Birds.</seg>
<seg id="84">于是，他便扮作医生，带着医生所使用的专业器具，装模作样地来到鸟房前，假装问候里面的鸟儿身体状况。</seg>
<seg id="85">"We shall do very well," they replied, without letting him in, "when we've seen the last of you."</seg>
<seg id="85">“我们都很健康，”鸟儿们回答说，并没有让猫进去，“一看到你的大尾巴，我们就全好了。”</seg>
<seg id="86">A villain may disguise himself, but he will not deceive the wise.</seg>
<seg id="86">骗子会伪装自己，但决骗不过聪明人。</seg>
<seg id="87">THE SPENDTHRIFT AND THE SWALLOW</seg>
<seg id="87">败家子与燕子</seg>
<seg id="88">A Spendthrift, who had wasted his fortune, and had nothing left but the clothes in which he stood, saw a Swallow one fine day in early spring.</seg>
<seg id="88">一个败家子因为挥霍无度而白白耗费了所有的财产。在一个早春的日子里，除了身上的衣服之外，已经别无所有的他，看到一只燕子。</seg>
<seg id="89">Thinking that summer had come, and that he could now do without his coat, he went and sold it for what it would fetch.</seg>
<seg id="89">他心里想着，应该是夏天来临，可以不再需要身上的外套了。于是，他出去想卖掉外套，换点什么东西。</seg>
<seg id="90">A change, however, took place in the weather, and there came a sharp frost which killed the unfortunate Swallow.</seg>
<seg id="90">不料，天气骤变，忽然降临的一场霜冻冻死了不幸的燕子。</seg>
<seg id="91">When the Spendthrift saw its dead body he cried, "Miserable bird!</seg>
<seg id="91">败家子看到燕子的尸体后，大喊道：“可怜的小鸟！</seg>
<seg id="92">Thanks to you I am perishing of cold myself."</seg>
<seg id="92">都是因为你，我才会也跟着挨冻呀。”</seg>
<seg id="93">One swallow does not make summer.</seg>
<seg id="93">一燕不成夏。</seg>
<seg id="94">THE OLD WOMAN AND THE DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="94">老太婆与医生</seg>
<seg id="95">An Old Woman became almost totally blind from a disease of the eyes, and, after consulting a Doctor, made an agreement with him in the presence of witnesses that she should pay him a high fee if he cured her, while if he failed he was to receive nothing.</seg>
<seg id="95">有个老太婆，几乎因为眼疾而失明了，在咨询过医生之后，他们达成了协议——如果医生能治好她的病，她将支付高额费用；如果医生治不好她的病，她就分文不给。</seg>
<seg id="96">The Doctor accordingly prescribed a course of treatment, and every time he paid her a visit he took away with him some article out of the house, until at last, when he visited her for the last time, and the cure was complete, there was nothing left.</seg>
<seg id="96">根据疗程计划，医生定期来她家里进行治疗，而且，每次来时总会顺手牵羊地偷走一些物品。终于，当他来做最后一次治疗时，老太婆家里的东西已经所剩无几了。</seg>
<seg id="97">When the Old Woman saw that the house was empty she refused to pay him his fee;</seg>
<seg id="97">虽然眼疾治好了，但是看到家里空荡荡的，老太婆便拒绝支付医疗费，</seg>
<seg id="98">and, after repeated refusals on her part, he sued her before the magistrates for payment of her debt.</seg>
<seg id="98">几次三番地拒付之后，医生便起诉了老太婆，让法官帮他追讨欠款。</seg>
<seg id="99">On being brought into court she was ready with her defence.</seg>
<seg id="99">被带到法官那里时，老太婆已经准备好为自己辩护了。</seg>
<seg id="100">"The claimant," said she, "has stated the facts about our agreement correctly.</seg>
<seg id="100">她说：“原告的确如实地陈述了我们之间的协议，</seg>
<seg id="101">I undertook to pay him a fee if he cured me, and he, on his part, promised to charge nothing if he failed.</seg>
<seg id="101">我曾经许诺过，如果他能治好我的病，就会支付给他治疗费，而且，他也曾应允过我，如果治不好我的病，就分文不取。</seg>
<seg id="102">Now, he says I am cured; but I say that I am blinder than ever, and I can prove what I say.</seg>
<seg id="102">现在，他说我已经痊愈了，可是我认为我的眼睛比以前更瞎了，就此而言，我完全能证明情况属实。</seg>
<seg id="103">When my eyes were bad I could at any rate see well enough to be aware that my house contained a certain amount of furniture and other things;</seg>
<seg id="103">以前，当我的视力下降之后，尚且能看见家里的一些家具和物品，</seg>
<seg id="104">but now, when according to him I am cured, I am entirely unable to see anything there at all."</seg>
<seg id="104">可是现在，当医生说我已经痊愈时，我却看不见任何东西了。”</seg>
<seg id="105">THE MOON AND HER MOTHER</seg>
<seg id="105">月亮和妈妈</seg>
<seg id="106">The Moon once begged her Mother to make her a gown.</seg>
<seg id="106">有一次，月亮祈求妈妈给她做一件长袍。</seg>
<seg id="107">"How can I?" replied she; "there's no fitting your figure.</seg>
<seg id="107">“怎么做呀？”妈妈回答说，“根本没有适合你的尺寸呀。</seg>
<seg id="108">At one time you're a New Moon, and at another you're a Full Moon; and between whiles you're neither one nor the other."</seg>
<seg id="108">你有时是新月，有时又是满月，而且你时常变化着。”</seg>
<seg id="109">MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN</seg>
<seg id="109">墨丘利和樵夫</seg>
<seg id="110">A Woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river, when his axe, glancing off the trunk, flew out of his hands and fell into the water.</seg>
<seg id="110">有一个樵夫正在河边砍树，突然，就在他将斧子抽离树干的一刹那，斧子从他的手中滑落，掉进了水里。</seg>
<seg id="111">As he stood by the water's edge lamenting his loss, Mercury appeared and asked him the reason for his grief;</seg>
<seg id="111">他站在水边悲叹那丢失了的斧子时，墨丘利出现了，问他为什么如此伤心。</seg>
<seg id="112">and on learning what had happened, out of pity for his distress he dived into the river and, bringing up a golden axe, asked him if that was the one he had lost.</seg>
<seg id="112">问清缘由之后，出于对樵夫的同情，墨丘利跳进河里，举起一把金灿灿的斧子问他，这是不是他丢失了的那一把。</seg>
<seg id="113">The Woodman replied that it was not,</seg>
<seg id="113">樵夫说这不是他丢的。</seg>
<seg id="114">and Mercury then dived a second time, and, bringing up a silver axe, asked if that was his.</seg>
<seg id="114">于是，墨丘利又跳进河中，捞起一把银光闪闪的斧子，问他是不是这一把。</seg>
<seg id="115">"No, that is not mine either," said the Woodman.</seg>
<seg id="115">“不是，这也不是我丢的。”樵夫回答道。</seg>
<seg id="116">Once more Mercury dived into the river, and brought up the missing axe.</seg>
<seg id="116">墨丘利再一次跳进河里，捞起那把樵夫真正丢失了的斧子。</seg>
<seg id="117">The Woodman was overjoyed at recovering his property, and thanked his benefactor warmly;</seg>
<seg id="117">看到失而复得的斧子，樵夫喜出望外，对墨丘利感激万分。</seg>
<seg id="118">and the latter was so pleased with his honesty that he made him a present of the other two axes.</seg>
<seg id="118">然而，墨丘利也很赞赏樵夫的忠厚老实，就将另外两把斧子作为礼物送给了他。</seg>
<seg id="119">When the Woodman told the story to his companions, one of these was filled with envy of his good fortune and determined to try his luck for himself.</seg>
<seg id="119">樵夫把自己的经历讲给同伴听，其中一个人十分羡慕他的好运气，决定也去碰一碰运气。</seg>
<seg id="120">So he went and began to fell a tree at the edge of the river, and presently contrived to let his axe drop into the water.</seg>
<seg id="120">于是，他也来到河畔砍树，并故意将自己的斧子丢入河中。</seg>
<seg id="121">Mercury appeared as before, and, on learning that his axe had fallen in, he dived and brought up a golden axe, as he had done on the previous occasion.</seg>
<seg id="121">墨丘利像以前一样出现了，知道樵夫的斧子落入水中之后，他像上次一样跳进河里捞起一把金斧子。</seg>
<seg id="122">Without waiting to be asked whether it was his or not the fellow cried, "That's mine, that's mine," and stretched out his hand eagerly for the prize:</seg>
<seg id="122">还没等到墨丘利开口问他，这个人就大喊道：“是我的，这就是我的斧子。”并且迫切地伸手想去拿那把斧子，</seg>
<seg id="123">but Mercury was so disgusted at his dishonesty that he not only declined to give him the golden axe, but also refused to recover for him the one he had let fall into the stream.</seg>
<seg id="123">但墨丘利对他的不诚实很气愤，不仅拒绝把金斧子送给他，而且还拒绝帮他寻找掉入水中的那把斧子。</seg>
<seg id="124">Honesty is the best policy.</seg>
<seg id="124">正直诚实才是上策。</seg>
<seg id="125">THE ASS, THE FOX, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="125">驴、狐狸和狮子</seg>
<seg id="126">An Ass and a Fox went into partnership and sallied out to forage for food together.</seg>
<seg id="126">驴和狐狸商量好一起去觅食。</seg>
<seg id="127">They hadn't gone far before they saw a Lion coming their way, at which they were both dreadfully frightened.</seg>
<seg id="127">还没走出多远，突然看见一只狮子走过来，他们俩都吓得不得了。</seg>
<seg id="128">But the Fox thought he saw a way of saving his own skin, and went boldly up to the Lion and whispered in his ear, "I'll manage that you shall get hold of the Ass without the trouble of stalking him, if you'll promise to let me go free."</seg>
<seg id="128">然而，狐狸却想出一条妙计，可以保全自己的性命。他立即跑到狮子面前，附耳小声地说：“如果你答应放我走，我就能保证让你毫不费力地抓住那头驴。”</seg>
<seg id="129">The Lion agreed to this, and the Fox then rejoined his companion and contrived before long to lead him by a hidden pit, which some hunter had dug as a trap for wild animals, and into which he fell.</seg>
<seg id="129">狮子应允了他的提议，狐狸便引诱驴掉进了一个陷阱里，这是某些猎人为捕获野生动物而事先挖掘出的洞。</seg>
<seg id="130">When the Lion saw that the Ass was safely caught and couldn't get away, it was to the Fox that he first turned his attention, and he soon finished him off, and then at his leisure proceeded to feast upon the Ass.</seg>
<seg id="130">狮子见驴已被俘获，再也逃不掉了，于是便转向刚才和他说话的那只狐狸，很快便抓住狐狸吃掉了，然后再慢慢地去享受陷阱里的驴。</seg>
<seg id="131">Betray a friend, and you'll often find you have ruined yourself.</seg>
<seg id="131">背叛朋友，你也不会有好下场。</seg>
<seg id="132">THE LION AND THE MOUSE</seg>
<seg id="132">狮子与报恩的老鼠</seg>
<seg id="133">A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face.</seg>
<seg id="133">狮子在自己的窝里睡着了，却被一只跑到他脸上的老鼠吵醒了。</seg>
<seg id="134">Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="134">狮子非常生气，用爪子抓住老鼠，准备弄死他。</seg>
<seg id="135">The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life.</seg>
<seg id="135">战战兢兢的老鼠请求狮子饶了他的性命。</seg>
<seg id="136">"Please let me go," it cried, "and one day I will repay you for your kindness."</seg>
<seg id="136">“求你放了我吧，”老鼠哭喊道，“我肯定会报答你的恩情。”</seg>
<seg id="137">The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go.</seg>
<seg id="137">一个不足挂齿的小生命肯为自己做任何事，狮子被如此无意义的想法逗笑了，便随和地放他走了。</seg>
<seg id="138">But the Mouse's chance came, after all.</seg>
<seg id="138">不久，老鼠报恩的机会终于来了。</seg>
<seg id="139">One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot.</seg>
<seg id="139">有一天，狮子被猎人们布好的大网缠住了，愤怒地大吼起来，老鼠听到了狮子的哀嚎，迅速赶来。</seg>
<seg id="140">Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free.</seg>
<seg id="140">老鼠轻松地走过去开始噬咬绳索，很快就成功地放走了狮子。</seg>
<seg id="141">"There!" said the Mouse, "you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you:</seg>
<seg id="141">老鼠说：“看吧！当我许诺要报答你时，你还嘲笑我；</seg>
<seg id="142">but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."</seg>
<seg id="142">现在你可看到了，即便一只小老鼠也能帮助一头大狮子。”</seg>
<seg id="143">THE CROW AND THE PITCHER</seg>
<seg id="143">乌鸦和水罐</seg>
<seg id="144">A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst within sight of the remedy.</seg>
<seg id="144">一只口渴的乌鸦发现了一个大水罐，虽然里面没有多少水，但毕竟也能解解渴，于是她想尽办法用自己的长喙去接触水面，然而，尽管救命之水就在跟前，可她却无能为力。</seg>
<seg id="145">At last she hit upon a clever plan.</seg>
<seg id="145">最后，她想出一条妙计。</seg>
<seg id="146">She began dropping pebbles into the Pitcher, and with each pebble the water rose a little higher until at last it reached the brim, and the knowing bird was enabled to quench her thirst.</seg>
<seg id="146">乌鸦开始用嘴叼着石子投到水罐里，每丢进去一粒石子，水面就会上升一点。终于，水面上升到了乌鸦的嘴边，她高兴地喝到了水，解了口渴。</seg>
<seg id="147">Necessity is the mother of invention.</seg>
<seg id="147">需求是发明之母。</seg>
<seg id="148">THE BOYS AND THE FROGS</seg>
<seg id="148">男孩和青蛙</seg>
<seg id="149">Some mischievous Boys were playing on the edge of a pond, and, catching sight of some Frogs swimming about in the shallow water, they began to amuse themselves by pelting them with stones, and they killed several of them.</seg>
<seg id="149">几个淘气的孩子在水池边玩耍，浅水中正在游泳的几只青蛙映入了他们的眼帘，他们便用石头去打青蛙，以此作为消遣娱乐。甚至于，他们还打死了几只青蛙。</seg>
<seg id="150">At last one of the Frogs put his head out of the water and said, "Oh, stop! stop!</seg>
<seg id="150">最后，一只青蛙从水中伸出头来，说：“住手！住手！</seg>
<seg id="151">I beg of you:</seg>
<seg id="151">求你们不要再打了。</seg>
<seg id="152">what is sport to you is death to us."</seg>
<seg id="152">对你们来说，这是一个活动，可是对于我们来说，却是致命一击啊。”</seg>
<seg id="153">THE NORTH WIND AND THE SUN</seg>
<seg id="153">北风与太阳</seg>
<seg id="154">A dispute arose between the North Wind and the Sun, each claiming that he was stronger than the other.</seg>
<seg id="154">北风与太阳争论不休，双方都在强调自己的能量更大。</seg>
<seg id="155">At last they agreed to try their powers upon a traveller, to see which could soonest strip him of his cloak.</seg>
<seg id="155">最后，他们一致赞同在一个行人身上试验自己的力量，看看谁能够最快速地让行人脱下衣服。</seg>
<seg id="156">The North Wind had the first try; and, gathering up all his force for the attack, he came whirling furiously down upon the man, and caught up his cloak as though he would wrest it from him by one single effort:</seg>
<seg id="156">北风先开始发威，他用尽全身力气攻击行人，猛烈的旋风向着行人袭来，并且拖住他的衣角以便使行人身上的衣服自行脱落；</seg>
<seg id="157">but the harder he blew, the more closely the man wrapped it round himself.</seg>
<seg id="157">然而，风吹得越猛烈，这个行人越是紧紧裹住了自己的衣服。</seg>
<seg id="158">Then came the turn of the Sun.</seg>
<seg id="158">接下来，该太阳上场了。</seg>
<seg id="159">At first he beamed gently upon the traveller, who soon unclasped his cloak and walked on with it hanging loosely about his shoulders:</seg>
<seg id="159">太阳开始温和地照耀着行人，行人很快就边走边解开衣服上的扣子，将其松散地搭在肩上；</seg>
<seg id="160">then he shone forth in his full strength, and the man, before he had gone many steps, was glad to throw his cloak right off and complete his journey more lightly clad.</seg>
<seg id="160">接着，太阳强烈地发光射向大地，已经走了很久的行人开心地脱掉衣服，轻装上阵。</seg>
<seg id="161">Persuasion is better than force</seg>
<seg id="161">温和的说服胜于蛮横的武力。</seg>
<seg id="162">THE MISTRESS AND HER SERVANTS</seg>
<seg id="162">女主人和仆人</seg>
<seg id="163">A Widow, thrifty and industrious, had two servants, whom she kept pretty hard at work.</seg>
<seg id="163">一个寡妇，既节俭又勤劳，她对两个仆人的要求也相当严厉。</seg>
<seg id="164">They were not allowed to lie long abed in the mornings, but the old lady had them up and doing as soon as the cock crew.</seg>
<seg id="164">每当公鸡一打鸣，这个老女人就叫她们起来去干活，不让她们多睡一会儿。</seg>
<seg id="165">They disliked intensely having to get up at such an hour, especially in winter-time: and they thought that if it were not for the cock waking up their Mistress so horribly early, they could sleep longer.</seg>
<seg id="165">仆人们都不喜欢在这么早的时间起床，尤其是在冬天里，她们以为，若是那只公鸡不在这么早的时候叫醒女主人，她们还能多睡一会儿。</seg>
<seg id="166">So they caught it and wrung its neck.</seg>
<seg id="166">于是，她们捉住公鸡，拧断了它的脖子。</seg>
<seg id="167">But they weren't prepared for the consequences.</seg>
<seg id="167">但是，她们并没有预料到更严重的后果。</seg>
<seg id="168">For what happened was that their Mistress, not hearing the cock crow as usual, waked them up earlier than ever, and set them to work in the middle of the night.</seg>
<seg id="168">女主人听不到公鸡的叫声了，却比往常更早地叫醒她们，在半夜里就让她们去干活。</seg>
<seg id="169">THE GOODS AND THE ILLS</seg>
<seg id="169">善与恶</seg>
<seg id="170">There was a time in the youth of the world when Goods and Ills entered equally into the concerns of men, so that the Goods did not prevail to make them altogether blessed, nor the Ills to make them wholly miserable.</seg>
<seg id="170">世界形成之初，善与恶平等地并存于人心，这样一来，善不曾受称赞，恶也不曾遭唾弃。</seg>
<seg id="171">But owing to the foolishness of mankind the Ills multiplied greatly in number and increased in strength, until it seemed as though they would deprive the Goods of all share in human affairs, and banish them from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="171">但是，由于人类的愚蠢，恶开始成倍增加，其力量也相继强大起来，后来似乎要剥夺所有善应占有的份额，将其驱逐出地球。</seg>
<seg id="172">The latter, therefore, betook themselves to heaven and complained to Jupiter of the treatment they had received, at the same time praying him to grant them protection from the Ills, and to advise them concerning the manner of their intercourse with men.</seg>
<seg id="172">因此，力量弱小的善努力回到了天上，向朱庇特（即宙斯，罗马神话中的主神）抱怨自己的遭遇，同时祈请他同意自己对恶的防卫，并且还征询重返人间的建议。</seg>
<seg id="173">Jupiter granted their request for protection, and decreed that for the future they should not go among men openly in a body, and so be liable to attack from the hostile Ills, but singly and unobserved, and at infrequent and unexpected intervals.</seg>
<seg id="173">朱庇特同意了他们寻求庇护的请求，并且还下令让他们将来不要公然地进入人间，因为这样易于受到心怀敌意的邪恶攻击，而是要逐一悄然地回归，不要太频繁，应在人们的意料之外。</seg>
<seg id="174">Hence it is that the earth is full of Ills, for they come and go as they please and are never far away;</seg>
<seg id="174">由此，这个地球上充满了邪恶，因为他们可以随意地往返，而且永远不会远离人类，</seg>
<seg id="175">while Goods, alas! come one by one only, and have to travel all the way from heaven, so that they are very seldom seen.</seg>
<seg id="175">而善则只能一个一个地来，他们要想方设法地从天上下来，必须悄悄地，才能不被发现。</seg>
<seg id="176">THE HARES AND THE FROGS</seg>
<seg id="176">野兔与青蛙</seg>
<seg id="177">The Hares once gathered together and lamented the unhappiness of their lot, exposed as they were to dangers on all sides and lacking the strength and the courage to hold their own.</seg>
<seg id="177">有一次，众多野兔聚集在一起，哀悼自己的不幸命运，方方面面都遭遇危险，而他们却缺乏勇气和力量去掌握自己的命运。</seg>
<seg id="178">Men, dogs, birds and beasts of prey were all their enemies, and killed and devoured them daily:</seg>
<seg id="178">人、狗、鸟类和猛兽等都是他们的敌人，整日屠杀吞噬他们。</seg>
<seg id="179">and sooner than endure such persecution any longer, they one and all determined to end their miserable lives.</seg>
<seg id="179">一想到要忍受这样的迫害，他们都认为还不如一死了之呢。</seg>
<seg id="180">Thus resolved and desperate, they rushed in a body towards a neighbouring pool, intending to drown themselves.</seg>
<seg id="180">于是，他们下定决心、不顾一切地来到附近的池塘边，准备投水自尽。</seg>
<seg id="181">On the bank were sitting a number of Frogs, who, when they heard the noise of the Hares as they ran, with one accord leaped into the water and hid themselves in the depths.</seg>
<seg id="181">有一群青蛙正围坐在池塘边，听到兔子们那急促的跑步声后，青蛙们立即纷纷跳入水中。</seg>
<seg id="182">Then one of the older Hares who was wiser than the rest cried out to his companions, "Stop, my friends, take heart;</seg>
<seg id="182">兔子中，有一只年长的兔子比同伴们聪明一些，“朋友们，快停下来，我们应该振作起来，</seg>
<seg id="183">don't let us destroy ourselves after all:</seg>
<seg id="183">不要再自寻短见了！</seg>
<seg id="184">see, here are creatures who are afraid of us, and who must, therefore, be still more timid than ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="184">你们看，这里还有一些害怕我们的动物呢，他们肯定比我们更胆小！”</seg>
<seg id="185">THE FOX AND THE STORK</seg>
<seg id="185">狐狸与鹤</seg>
<seg id="186">A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup.</seg>
<seg id="186">狐狸请鹤来吃晚饭，然而他所款待客人的，仅仅是一个大平底盘子里盛的一点汤。</seg>
<seg id="187">The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth.</seg>
<seg id="187">狐狸津津有味地舔食平盘里的汤，而鹤却无法用他那长喙吸食香喷喷的浓汤。</seg>
<seg id="188">Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement.</seg>
<seg id="188">鹤十分气恼，这让狡猾的狐狸十分开心。</seg>
<seg id="189">But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease.</seg>
<seg id="189">然而，没过多久，鹤回请狐狸吃饭，他在狐狸面前摆放了一只颈长口小的罐子，可以让鹤轻易地将长嘴伸进去。</seg>
<seg id="190">Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel.</seg>
<seg id="190">这一次，当他从容地吃着罐子里的食物时，狐狸却只能眼巴巴地看着，因为他根本无法够到罐子里诱人的饭菜。</seg>
<seg id="191">THE WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING</seg>
<seg id="191">披着羊皮的狼</seg>
<seg id="192">A Wolf resolved to disguise himself in order that he might prey upon a flock of sheep without fear of detection.</seg>
<seg id="192">为了不被察觉地捕食一群羊，狼下定决心要伪装自己。</seg>
<seg id="193">So he clothed himself in a sheepskin, and slipped among the sheep when they were out at pasture.</seg>
<seg id="193">于是，他披上了一身羊皮，趁羊群在牧场里游荡时悄然混进去。</seg>
<seg id="194">He completely deceived the shepherd, and when the flock was penned for the night he was shut in with the rest.</seg>
<seg id="194">他完全骗过了放羊倌，晚上羊群被关进栏里时，他也被一起关了进去。</seg>
<seg id="195">But that very night as it happened, the shepherd, requiring a supply of mutton for the table, laid hands on the Wolf in mistake for a Sheep, and killed him with his knife on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="195">但是，就在那个晚上，牧羊人想要吃羊肉了，于是把手放在披着羊皮的狼身上，一刀就杀了他。</seg>
<seg id="196">THE STAG IN THE OX-STALL</seg>
<seg id="196">牛棚里的雄鹿</seg>
<seg id="197">A Stag, chased from his lair by the hounds, took refuge in a farmyard, and, entering a stable where a number of oxen were stalled, thrust himself under a pile of hay in a vacant stall, where he lay concealed, all but the tips of his horns.</seg>
<seg id="197">一只雄鹿被猎狗赶出了巢穴，只得躲进一个农家小院里。他闯进了一个满是公牛的牛棚里，拼命挤进空牛栏的干草堆中，藏了起来，但是他的鹿角却一直露在外面。</seg>
<seg id="198">Presently one of the Oxen said to him, "What has induced you to come in here?</seg>
<seg id="198">不久，一头公牛对他说：“是什么原因让你到这里来自投罗网呢？</seg>
<seg id="199">Aren't you aware of the risk you are running of being captured by the herdsmen?"</seg>
<seg id="199">待在这里很危险，会被牧人抓走的，你知不知道？”</seg>
<seg id="200">To which he replied, "Pray let me stay for the present.</seg>
<seg id="200">雄鹿回答说：“求求你，就让我在这里待一会儿吧。</seg>
<seg id="201">When night comes I shall easily escape under cover of the dark."</seg>
<seg id="201">当夜幕降临后，我就能有机会在黑暗中逃走了。”</seg>
<seg id="202">In the course of the afternoon more than one of the farm-hands came in, to attend to the wants of the cattle, but not one of them noticed the presence of the Stag, who accordingly began to congratulate himself on his escape and to express his gratitude to the Oxen.</seg>
<seg id="202">整个下午都很平安，虽然有几个雇工来牛棚照料牛群，但是没有一个人注意到雄鹿的存在，雄鹿一边暗自庆幸可以平安逃走，一边对公牛表示感激。</seg>
<seg id="203">"We wish you well," said the one who had spoken before, "but you are not out of danger yet.</seg>
<seg id="203">“我们都希望你能平安，”先前曾和雄鹿讲话的那头公牛又开口了，“但是，你还没有完全脱离危险。</seg>
<seg id="204">If the master comes, you will certainly be found out, for nothing ever escapes his keen eyes."</seg>
<seg id="204">如果主人来了，你可能就会被发现，因为没有什么能逃出他的眼睛。”</seg>
<seg id="205">Presently, sure enough, in he came, and made a great to-do about the way the Oxen were kept.</seg>
<seg id="205">正说着，农场主来了，开始抱怨工人没有好好照料牛群。</seg>
<seg id="206">"The beasts are starving," he cried; "here, give them more hay, and put plenty of litter under them."</seg>
<seg id="206">“牲口都饿着呢，”他大喊道，“这里再多加点干草，要给他们足够的铺垫。”</seg>
<seg id="207">As he spoke, he seized an armful himself from the pile where the Stag lay concealed, and at once detected him.</seg>
<seg id="207">他一边说着话，一边查看着雄鹿躲身的干草堆，立刻就认出了雄鹿。</seg>
<seg id="208">Calling his men, he had him seized at once and killed for the table.</seg>
<seg id="208">于是，他叫来帮工，立刻抓住雄鹿并杀死它美餐了一顿。</seg>
<seg id="209">THE MILKMAID AND HER PAIL</seg>
<seg id="209">挤奶女孩和她的桶</seg>
<seg id="210">A farmer's daughter had been out to milk the cows, and was returning to the dairy carrying her pail of milk upon her head.</seg>
<seg id="210">一个农场主的女儿挤完牛奶后，头顶着一桶牛奶，从田野里走回农庄。</seg>
<seg id="211">As she walked along, she fell a-musing after this fashion: "The milk in this pail will provide me with cream, which I will make into butter and take to market to sell.</seg>
<seg id="211">她边走边开始想入非非：“从这桶牛奶里可以得到奶酪，也能得到奶油，就可以拿到市场上去卖。</seg>
<seg id="212">With the money I will buy a number of eggs, and these, when hatched, will produce chickens, and by and by I shall have quite a large poultry-yard.</seg>
<seg id="212">用卖得的钱，我还可以买回一些鸡蛋。这些鸡蛋还可以再孵出成群的小鸡。如此算来，我就能拥有一个大型的家禽场了。</seg>
<seg id="213">Then I shall sell some of my fowls, and with the money which they will bring in I will buy myself a new gown, which I shall wear when I go to the fair;</seg>
<seg id="213">然后，我再卖掉那些牲畜，用卖得的钱，我就能买一条漂亮的长裙子，可以穿着到集市上去；</seg>
<seg id="214">and all the young fellows will admire it, and come and make love to me, but I shall toss my head and have nothing to say to them."</seg>
<seg id="214">年轻的小伙子们都会赞美裙子，都会过来向我示爱，而我却要摇摇头，什么也不说。”</seg>
<seg id="215">Forgetting all about the pail, and suiting the action to the word, she tossed her head.</seg>
<seg id="215">想到这里，她完全忘记了头顶上的桶，配合着自己的想法，她真的摇起头来。</seg>
<seg id="216">Down went the pail, all the milk was spilled, and all her fine castles in the air vanished in a moment!</seg>
<seg id="216">结果，头顶上的牛奶桶掉在了地上，所有的牛奶都洒出来了，她的美妙幻想也随之消失了。</seg>
<seg id="217">Do not count your chickens before they are hatched.</seg>
<seg id="217">不要高兴得太早。</seg>
<seg id="218">THE DOLPHINS, THE WHALES, AND THE SPRAT</seg>
<seg id="218">海豚、鲸和西鲱鱼</seg>
<seg id="219">The Dolphins quarrelled with the Whales, and before very long they began fighting with one another.</seg>
<seg id="219">海豚与鲸争吵起来，他们之间已经争斗了很久。</seg>
<seg id="220">The battle was very fierce, and had lasted some time without any sign of coming to an end, when a Sprat thought that perhaps he could stop it;</seg>
<seg id="220">战争进一步升级，并且越打越猛烈，根本没有一点要停的迹象，有一条西鲱鱼认为自己或许能够调停他们的战争，</seg>
<seg id="221">so he stepped in and tried to persuade them to give up fighting and make friends.</seg>
<seg id="221">便过去准备劝他们停止争斗，成为朋友。</seg>
<seg id="222">But one of the Dolphins said to him contemptuously, "We would rather go on fighting till we're all killed than be reconciled by a Sprat like you!"</seg>
<seg id="222">但是，海豚轻蔑地对他说：“我们宁可争斗到同归于尽，也不会让一条像你这样的西鲱鱼来调解！”</seg>
<seg id="223">THE FOX AND THE MONKEY</seg>
<seg id="223">狐狸和猴子</seg>
<seg id="224">A Fox and a Monkey were on the road together, and fell into a dispute as to which of the two was the better born.</seg>
<seg id="224">狐狸与猴子同行，一路上都在争吵谁的家世更高贵。</seg>
<seg id="225">They kept it up for some time, till they came to a place where the road passed through a cemetery full of monuments, when the Monkey stopped and looked about him and gave a great sigh.</seg>
<seg id="225">他们各自坚持着夸耀自己，边说边来到一个路边满是墓碑的地方。这时，猴子停下来，四处观望，然后放声大哭。</seg>
<seg id="226">"Why do you sigh?" said the Fox.</seg>
<seg id="226">“你为什么这样呀？”狐狸忙问道。</seg>
<seg id="227">The Monkey pointed to the tombs and replied, "All the monuments that you see here were put up in honour of my forefathers, who in their day were eminent men."</seg>
<seg id="227">猴子指着那些墓碑，说：“你在这里看到的所有墓碑都是我祖先的荣誉，他们当时可都是杰出的人士！”</seg>
<seg id="228">The Fox was speechless for a moment, but quickly recovering he said, "Oh! don't stop at any lie, sir;</seg>
<seg id="228">狐狸沉默了一会儿，但是很快就反驳道：“噢！接着吹吧，先生，</seg>
<seg id="229">you're quite safe:</seg>
<seg id="229">不会有人揭穿你的——</seg>
<seg id="230">I'm sure none of your ancestors will rise up and expose you."</seg>
<seg id="230">我相信，他们之中没有人能站起来反驳你。”</seg>
<seg id="231">Boasters brag most when they cannot be detected.</seg>
<seg id="231">谎言无法被揭穿时，吹牛者便会夸夸其谈。</seg>
<seg id="232">THE ASS AND THE LAP-DOG</seg>
<seg id="232">驴和哈巴狗</seg>
<seg id="233">There was once a man who had an Ass and a Lap-dog.</seg>
<seg id="233">有人养了一头驴和一只哈巴狗。</seg>
<seg id="234">The Ass was housed in the stable with plenty of oats and hay to eat and was as well off as an ass could be.</seg>
<seg id="234">驴被圈养在棚子里，虽然不愁温饱，有着足够的燕麦和干草供应，却每天都要尽驴子应尽的本分。</seg>
<seg id="235">The little Dog was made a great pet of by his master, who fondled him and often let him lie in his lap;</seg>
<seg id="235">小狗颇会讨好它的主人，而主人则经常抚摸它，让它坐在自己的膝盖上。</seg>
<seg id="236">and if he went out to dinner, he would bring back a tit-bit or two to give him when he ran to meet him on his return.</seg>
<seg id="236">假如主人出外吃饭，还会想着带一点好吃的回来，等见到小狗时给它作为奖励。</seg>
<seg id="237">The Ass had, it is true, a good deal of work to do, carting or grinding the corn, or carrying the burdens of the farm:</seg>
<seg id="237">驴子的确是工作繁重，他不仅要到磨坊里拉磨，还要去树林里驮木材。</seg>
<seg id="238">and ere long he became very jealous, contrasting his own life of labour with the ease and idleness of the Lap-dog.</seg>
<seg id="238">与哈巴狗的悠闲自在相比，驴子难免会心生嫉妒，怀有怨言。</seg>
<seg id="239">At last one day he broke his halter, and frisking into the house just as his master sat down to dinner, he pranced and capered about, mimicking the frolics of the little favourite, upsetting the table and smashing the crockery with his clumsy efforts.</seg>
<seg id="239">有一天，机会终于来了，驴子挣断缰绳，跑进主人的房间，模仿哈巴狗的样子围着主人跳舞，又蹦又踢，不仅撞翻了桌子，还把碗碟摔得粉碎。</seg>
<seg id="240">Not content with that, he even tried to jump on his master's lap, as he had so often seen the dog allowed to do.</seg>
<seg id="240">不仅如此，驴子甚至还试图跳到主人的膝盖上，因为他经常看到小狗如此。</seg>
<seg id="241">At that the servants, seeing the danger their master was in, belaboured the silly Ass with sticks and cudgels, and drove him back to his stable half dead with his beating.</seg>
<seg id="241">仆人们见此情景，都吓坏了，以为主人面临着危险，于是用棍棒把驴子赶回棚里，打了个半死。</seg>
<seg id="242">"Alas!" he cried, "all this I have brought on myself.</seg>
<seg id="242">“唉！”他哭喊着，“我这不是自作自受吗，</seg>
<seg id="243">Why could I not be satisfied with my natural and honourable position, without wishing to imitate the ridiculous antics of that useless little Lap-dog?"</seg>

<seg id="245">一棵冷杉树用轻蔑的口吻对着荆棘夸口道：“你这可怜的东西，一点用处也没有。</seg>
<seg id="246">Now, look at me: I am useful for all sorts of things, particularly when men build houses; they can't do without me then."</seg>
<seg id="246">你看看我，我可是对万物都有益处，尤其是当人类要盖房子的时候，没有我根本就不行。”</seg>
<seg id="247">But the Bramble replied, "Ah, that's all very well:</seg>
<seg id="247">但是荆棘回答：“是啊！那的确很好。</seg>
<seg id="248">but you wait till they come with axes and saws to cut you down, and then you'll wish you were a Bramble and not a Fir."</seg>
<seg id="248">不过，等到他们拿着斧头和锯来把你砍倒时，你就会希望自己是荆棘，而不是冷杉树了。”</seg>

<seg id="260">“多么美的嗓音啊！”他说，“我很高兴能认识一位声音悦耳动听的公鸡。”</seg>

<seg id="261">而公鸡则回答说：“你能先叫醒树洞里那个看门的吗？</seg>
<seg id="262">He'll open the door and let you in."</seg>

<seg id="263">The Fox accordingly rapped on the trunk, when out rushed the Dog and tore him in pieces.</seg>

<seg id="266">等他歇够了脚，准备飞走时，对公牛说：“我现在飞走，你不介意吧？”</seg>

<seg id="268">I didn't notice when you came, and I shan't know when you go away."</seg>

<seg id="272">还没等熊看到他们，其中一个立即闪电般地抢先爬上树，躲了起来。</seg>
<seg id="273">The other was not so nimble as his companion; and, as he could not escape, he threw himself on the ground and pretended to be dead.</seg>
<seg id="273">而另一个眼见逃生无望，便灵机一动躺倒在地上，假装死了。</seg>
<seg id="274">The Bear came up and sniffed all round him, but he kept perfectly still and held his breath: for they say that a bear will not touch a dead body.</seg>
<seg id="274">熊走到他跟前，用鼻子在他脸上嗅了嗅，转身就走了，但他依然屏住呼吸、安然不动，因为他们听说，熊从来不碰死人。</seg>
<seg id="275">The Bear took him for a corpse, and went away.</seg>
<seg id="275">熊还真把他当成了死人，径自走开了。</seg>
<seg id="276">When the coast was clear, the Traveller in the tree came down, and asked the other what it was the Bear had whispered to him when he put his mouth to his ear.</seg>
<seg id="276">躲在树上的人下来后，问躺在地上的朋友，熊在他耳边说了些什么。</seg>
<seg id="277">The other replied, "He told me never again to travel with a friend who deserts you at the first sign of danger."</seg>

<seg id="280">一个奴隶因不堪忍受主人的残暴虐待而逃跑了，为了避免被抓住，他逃进了沙漠中。</seg>
<seg id="281">As he wandered about in search of food and shelter, he came to a cave, which he entered and found to be unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="281">正当他思忖着该如何寻找食物和栖身之地时，来到了一个洞穴前，他走进去看了看，空无一人。</seg>
<seg id="282">Really, however, it was a Lion's den, and almost immediately, to the horror of the wretched fugitive, the Lion himself appeared.</seg>
<seg id="282">然而，这是一个狮子的巢穴，就在这时，狮子出现了，可怜的逃亡者吓呆了。</seg>
<seg id="283">The man gave himself up for lost: but, to his utter astonishment, the Lion, instead of springing upon him and devouring him, came and fawned upon him, at the same time whining and lifting up his paw.</seg>
<seg id="283">他认定自己无处可逃，然而，完全出乎他的意料，狮子不但没有扑过来吃掉他，反而过来巴巴地讨好他，一边哭诉着，一边抬起自己的爪子。</seg>
<seg id="284">Observing it to be much swollen and inflamed, he examined it and found a large thorn embedded in the ball of the foot.</seg>
<seg id="284">看到那个爪子又肿又胀，还在发炎，逃亡者认真地检查了一下，发现有一根刺深嵌入狮子的脚掌里。</seg>
<seg id="285">He accordingly removed it and dressed the wound as well as he could:</seg>

<seg id="287">The Lion's gratitude was unbounded;</seg>

<seg id="288">he looked upon the man as his friend, and they shared the cave for some time together.</seg>
<seg id="288">将他当成了自己的朋友，从此他们一起分享这个洞穴。</seg>
<seg id="289">A day came, however, when the Slave began to long for the society of his fellow-men, and he bade farewell to the Lion and returned to the town.</seg>
<seg id="289">过了一段时间，有一天，奴隶开始渴望回到人类的社会生活中，他向狮子告别，然后回到镇子上。</seg>

<seg id="290">他一出现，立刻就被认出来，接着就被带上镣铐，送到了前主人那里。主人惩罚了他以示警戒，并且还命令道，在下次马戏表演时应该把他扔给野兽。</seg>

<seg id="294">It was his old friend of the cave!</seg>
<seg id="294">这正是他在洞里生活时的老朋友！</seg>
<seg id="295">The audience clamoured that the Slave's life should be spared:</seg>
<seg id="295">观众都嚷嚷着应该饶了这个奴隶的命，</seg>
<seg id="296">and the governor of the town, marvelling at such gratitude and fidelity in a beast, decreed that both should receive their liberty.</seg>
<seg id="296">镇子上的官员也惊讶于一头野兽的感恩与忠诚，下令让奴隶和狮子都获得自由。</seg>

<seg id="299">Holding it between his finger and thumb, he said--or rather shouted, so angry was he--"Who are you, pray, you wretched little creature, that you make so free with my person?"</seg>
<seg id="299">他用食指和拇指捏着跳蚤说，或者可能因为生气，几乎是怒吼道：“你是谁？你这个让人厌恶的小生命，为何在我身上如此放肆？”</seg>
<seg id="300">The Flea, terrified, whimpered in a weak little voice, "Oh, sir!</seg>
<seg id="300">受了惊吓的跳蚤小声呜咽道：“哦，先生，</seg>

<seg id="309">蜂王说，如果能赐予蜜蜂们蜂针，从而能够惩治那些偷走蜂蜜的人，她就不胜感激了。</seg>

<seg id="316">橡树掉入了水边的芦苇丛中，于是对芦苇说：“我这么强壮，都能被狂风连根拔起、落入水中，而你们如此脆弱纤细，究竟是如何渡过难关的？”“你太顽固了，”</seg>
<seg id="317">"You were stubborn," came the reply, "and fought against the storm, which proved stronger than you:</seg>

<seg id="318">but we bow and yield to every breeze, and thus the gale passed harmlessly over our heads."</seg>

<seg id="337">那人连忙说：“他们都是猴王您的得力干将。”</seg>
<seg id="338">The Ape was so delighted with his answer that he gave him a very handsome present.</seg>
<seg id="338">猴王听到他的这番恭维十分高兴，给了他丰盛的礼物。</seg>
<seg id="339">The other Traveller thought that if his companion was rewarded so splendidly for telling a lie, he himself would certainly receive a still greater reward for telling the truth;</seg>
<seg id="339">另外一个说真话的人心里暗自琢磨，若是同伴的一番谎话都能得到如此丰厚的回报，那么，我这样一个说实话的老实人，肯定会得到比他更多的奖赏了。</seg>

<seg id="345">The salt got thoroughly wetted and much of it melted and drained away, so that, when he got on his legs again, the Ass found his load had become much less heavy.</seg>
<seg id="345">盐巴全都落入水中打湿了，其中一部分盐已经溶化，被水流冲走，所以，当他再次驮起盐巴，驴发现自己的担子明显轻了很多。</seg>
<seg id="346">His master, however, drove him back to town and bought more salt, which he added to what remained in the panniers, and started out again.</seg>
<seg id="346">然而，他的主人又赶着他回到镇上，买了更多的盐，添加到原有的那些货物上，重新出发。</seg>

<seg id="364">The Goat thought of nothing but the prospect of quenching his thirst, and jumped in at once.</seg>
<seg id="364">一心只想喝水的山羊信以为真，便不假思索地跳了下去，</seg>
<seg id="365">When he had had enough to drink, he looked about, like the Fox, for some way of getting out, but could find none.</seg>
<seg id="365">当他“咕咚咕咚”痛饮完，就不得不开始思考爬上井去的办法，可他也像狐狸那样一筹莫展。</seg>
<seg id="366">Presently the Fox said, "I have an idea.</seg>
<seg id="366">狐狸早有准备，他狡猾地说：“我倒有一个方法。</seg>
<seg id="367">You stand on your hind legs, and plant your forelegs firmly against the side of the well, and then I'll climb on to your back, and, from there, by stepping on your horns, I can get out.</seg>
<seg id="367">你用前脚扒在井墙上，再把后腿蹬直了，我从你的后背跳上井去，</seg>
<seg id="368">And when I'm out, I'll help you out too."</seg>
<seg id="368">再拉你上来，这样我们就都得救了。”</seg>
<seg id="369">The Goat did as he was requested, and the Fox climbed on to his back and so out of the well; and then he coolly walked away.</seg>
<seg id="369">公山羊同意了他的提议，狐狸踩着山羊的后背跳出了井口，接着便大摇大摆地扬长而去。</seg>
<seg id="370">The Goat called loudly after him and reminded him of his promise to help him out:</seg>
<seg id="370">公山羊指责狐狸不信守诺言，没有把他拉上去。</seg>
<seg id="371">but the Fox merely turned and said, "If you had as much sense in your head as you have hair in your beard you wouldn't have got into the well without making certain that you could get out again."</seg>
<seg id="371">但是，狐狸却回过头来对公山羊说：“喂，朋友，如果你的心眼能像胡须那样多，就不至于在没想清楚应该如何跳出井之前，盲目地跳下去了。”</seg>
<seg id="372">Look before your leap.</seg>
<seg id="372">三思而行。</seg>
<seg id="373">THE FISHERMAN AND THE SPRAT</seg>
<seg id="373">渔夫和小鲱鱼</seg>
<seg id="374">A Fisherman cast his net into the sea, and when he drew it up again it contained nothing but a single Sprat that begged to be put back into the water.</seg>
<seg id="374">渔夫将网撒向大海，当他再次收网时，只看到一条翻腾着想回大海里去的小鲱鱼。</seg>
<seg id="375">"I'm only a little fish now," it said, "but I shall grow big one day, and then if you come and catch me again I shall be of some use to you."</seg>
<seg id="375">“我只是一条小鱼，”可怜的小鱼说，“但是我总有一天会长大，等我长大后，你再来抓我，那时才会对你更有好处。”</seg>
<seg id="376">But the Fisherman replied, "Oh, no, I shall keep you now I've got you:</seg>
<seg id="376">然而，渔夫却回答说：“不行，我现在就要留下你来，</seg>
<seg id="377">if I put you back, should I ever see you again?</seg>
<seg id="377">如果我放你回去，还会再看到你吗？</seg>
<seg id="378">Not likely!"</seg>
<seg id="378">绝对不会了！”</seg>
<seg id="379">THE BOASTING TRAVELLER</seg>
<seg id="379">吹牛的路人</seg>
<seg id="380">A Man once went abroad on his travels, and when he came home he had wonderful tales to tell of the things he had done in foreign countries.</seg>
<seg id="380">有一个人曾经出国去旅行，回家后他就大肆吹嘘在异国他乡曾有过的那些奇妙经历。</seg>
<seg id="381">Among other things, he said he had taken part in a jumping-match at Rhodes, and had done a wonderful jump which no one could beat.</seg>
<seg id="381">其中，他就提到曾在罗德岛参加过跳远比赛，而且还得了第一名。</seg>
<seg id="382">"Just go to Rhodes and ask them," he said; "every one will tell you it's true."</seg>
<seg id="382">“只要去罗德岛问问当地人，”他说，“他们都会告诉你这是真的。”</seg>
<seg id="383">But one of those who were listening said, "If you can jump as well as all that, we needn't go to Rhodes to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="383">当时在场的一个人对他说：“如果你现在也能跳得那么远，我们根本就不需要去罗德岛找证据了。</seg>
<seg id="384">Let's just imagine this is Rhodes for a minute: and now--jump!"</seg>
<seg id="384">我们姑且暂时把这里当做是罗德岛，你跳吧！”</seg>
<seg id="385">Deeds, not words.</seg>
<seg id="385">行动胜于雄辩。</seg>
<seg id="386">THE CRAB AND HIS MOTHER</seg>
<seg id="386">小螃蟹和他的妈妈</seg>
<seg id="387">An Old Crab said to her son, "Why do you walk sideways like that, my son?</seg>
<seg id="387">母蟹对小蟹说：“我的儿子，为什么你要这样横着走？</seg>
<seg id="388">You ought to walk straight."</seg>
<seg id="388">你应该直行。”</seg>
<seg id="389">The Young Crab replied, "Show me how, dear mother, and I'll follow your example."</seg>
<seg id="389">小螃蟹回答道：“妈妈，请您亲自教我怎样走，我会跟着您学的。”</seg>
<seg id="390">The Old Crab tried, but tried in vain, and then saw how foolish she had been to find fault with her child.</seg>
<seg id="390">母蟹试了几次，却根本不会直走，接着便发现自己竟然愚蠢地去指责孩子的错误。</seg>
<seg id="391">Example is better than precept.</seg>
<seg id="391">身教胜于言传。</seg>
<seg id="392">THE ASS AND HIS SHADOW</seg>
<seg id="392">驴和他的影子</seg>
<seg id="393">A certain man hired an Ass for a journey in summertime, and started out with the owner following behind to drive the beast.</seg>
<seg id="393">一次，某人为了夏日的旅行而雇了一头驴，于是，驴的主人跟在后面赶着驴出发了。</seg>
<seg id="394">By and by, in the heat of the day, they stopped to rest, and the traveller wanted to lie down in the Ass's Shadow;</seg>
<seg id="394">烈日当头的正午时分，越走越热的他们停下来休息。行人想要躺在驴的影子下休息，</seg>
<seg id="395">but the owner, who himself wished to be out of the sun, wouldn't let him do that;</seg>
<seg id="395">可是驴的主人也希望能够躲避太阳的照射，不想让他这么做，</seg>
<seg id="396">for he said he had hired the Ass only, and not his Shadow:</seg>
<seg id="396">因为行人只说雇佣了驴，没说要雇佣它的影子。</seg>
<seg id="397">the other maintained that his bargain secured him complete control of the Ass for the time being.</seg>
<seg id="397">而行人也坚持认为自己完全有权利控制驴的一切行为。</seg>
<seg id="398">From words they came to blows;</seg>
<seg id="398">他们争论不休，互相打了起来。</seg>
<seg id="399">and while they were belabouring each other the Ass took to his heels and was soon out of sight.</seg>
<seg id="399">就在他们打架时，驴逃之夭夭了。</seg>
<seg id="400">THE FARMER AND HIS SONS</seg>
<seg id="400">农夫和儿子</seg>
<seg id="401">A Farmer, being at death's door, and desiring to impart to his Sons a secret of much moment, called them round him and said, "My sons, I am shortly about to die;</seg>
<seg id="401">有个农夫已经奄奄一息，但还想告诉儿子们一个秘密，便叫来他们，说：“孩子们，我快要死了，</seg>
<seg id="402">I would have you know, therefore, that in my vineyard there lies a hidden treasure.</seg>
<seg id="402">但我还想让你们知道，葡萄园里有一个埋藏着的宝贝。</seg>
<seg id="403">Dig, and you will find it."</seg>
<seg id="403">挖出来，你们就知道是什么了！”</seg>
<seg id="404">As soon as their father was dead, the Sons took spade and fork and turned up the soil of the vineyard over and over again, in their search for the treasure which they supposed to lie buried there.</seg>
<seg id="404">父亲去世之后，他们用铁锹和铲子把那葡萄园的地翻了好几遍，到处寻找埋藏在那里的宝物。</seg>
<seg id="405">They found none, however: but the vines, after so thorough a digging, produced a crop such as had never before been seen.</seg>
<seg id="405">虽然什么都没找到，但是葡萄园的地经过此番挖掘，却比以往丰收了更多。</seg>
<seg id="406">THE DOG AND THE COOK</seg>
<seg id="406">狗和厨师</seg>
<seg id="407">A rich man once invited a number of his friends and acquaintances to a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="407">有一次，一个富翁设宴招待亲朋好友。</seg>
<seg id="408">His dog thought it would be a good opportunity to invite another Dog, a friend of his;</seg>
<seg id="408">这家的狗以为是个好机会，也高兴地跑去邀请自己的朋友——另一只狗，</seg>
<seg id="409">so he went to him and said, "My master is giving a feast:</seg>
<seg id="409">他跑过去对朋友说：“我的主人在摆宴席，</seg>
<seg id="410">there'll be a fine spread, so come and dine with me to-night."</seg>
<seg id="410">那里肯定有很多好吃的，快来，和我一起去赴宴吧。”</seg>
<seg id="411">The Dog thus invited came, and when he saw the preparations being made in the kitchen he said to himself, "My word, I'm in luck:</seg>
<seg id="411">受邀的狗于是欣然前往，见到厨房里摆着如此丰盛的饭菜，他就自言自语道：“我太幸运了！</seg>
<seg id="412">I'll take care to eat enough to-night to last me two or three days."</seg>
<seg id="412">这次一定要饱餐一顿，把明天和后天的饭都吃掉。”</seg>
<seg id="413">At the same time he wagged his tail briskly, by way of showing his friend how delighted he was to have been asked.</seg>
<seg id="413">与此同时，他不停地摇着尾巴，告诉朋友多么高兴受到了他的邀请。</seg>
<seg id="414">But just then the Cook caught sight of him, and, in his annoyance at seeing a strange Dog in the kitchen, caught him up by the hind legs and threw him out of the window.</seg>
<seg id="414">就在这时，厨师看见了他，见到一条陌生的狗在厨房里让厨师很生气，于是马上抓住他的后腿，扔到了窗外。</seg>
<seg id="415">He had a nasty fall, and limped away as quickly as he could, howling dismally.</seg>
<seg id="415">那条狗狠狠地摔了一跤，赶紧鬼哭狼嚎般地落荒而逃。</seg>
<seg id="416">Presently some other dogs met him, and said, "Well, what sort of a dinner did you get?"</seg>
<seg id="416">在路上遇见的其它几条狗都问他：“你参加的宴会怎么样呀？”</seg>
<seg id="417">To which he replied, "I had a splendid time:</seg>
<seg id="417">他竟然回答道：“我很好，</seg>
<seg id="418">the wine was so good, and I drank so much of it, that I really don't remember how I got out of the house!"</seg>
<seg id="418">那酒实在太好喝了，我已经醉了，完全不记得如何回家了！”</seg>
<seg id="419">Be shy of favours bestowed at the expense of others.</seg>
<seg id="419">享用借花献佛的恩惠是要付出代价的。</seg>

<seg id="420">当上国王的猴子</seg>
<seg id="421">At a gathering of all the animals the Monkey danced and delighted them so much that they made him their King.</seg>
<seg id="421">有一次，猴子在动物大聚会时跳起舞来，赢得了大家的好感，故而被选为动物之王。</seg>
<seg id="422">The Fox, however, was very much disgusted at the promotion of the Monkey:</seg>
<seg id="422">然而，狐狸十分嫉妒猴子当选为王。</seg>
<seg id="423">so having one day found a trap with a piece of meat in it, he took the Monkey there and said to him, "Here is a dainty morsel I have found, sire;</seg>
<seg id="423">有一天，当他发现一个捕兽夹子里有一块肉时，便把猴子带过去说：“我发现这里有些好吃的东西，陛下，</seg>
<seg id="424">I did not take it myself, because I thought it ought to be reserved for you, our King.</seg>
<seg id="424">但是我没敢动用，因为我认为应该留给国王享用。</seg>
<seg id="425">Will you be pleased to accept it?"</seg>
<seg id="425">您能亲自去取吗？”</seg>
<seg id="426">The Monkey made at once for the meat and got caught in the trap. Then he bitterly reproached the Fox for leading him into danger;</seg>
<seg id="426">猴子立刻跑过去拿，结果却被夹子夹住了。</seg>
<seg id="427">but the Fox only laughed and said, "O Monkey, you call yourself King of the Beasts and haven't more sense than to be taken in like that!"</seg>
<seg id="427">他斥责狐狸陷害他，而狐狸却笑着说：“猴子，你这种笨蛋竟然还想做万兽之王！”</seg>
<seg id="428">THE THIEVES AND THE COCK</seg>
<seg id="428">小偷和公鸡</seg>
<seg id="429">Some Thieves broke into a house, and found nothing worth taking except a Cock, which they seized and carried off with them.</seg>
<seg id="429">几个小偷悄悄地溜进一户人家里，那家人除了一只公鸡之外什么也没有，于是，小偷便偷走了那只公鸡。</seg>
<seg id="430">When they were preparing their supper, one of them caught up the Cock, and was about to wring his neck, when he cried out for mercy and said, "Pray do not kill me:</seg>
<seg id="430">当小偷们要杀鸡吃肉时，其中一个小偷抓住了公鸡，准备割断他的脖子，这时，公鸡可怜巴巴地说：“求求你别杀我，</seg>
<seg id="431">you will find me a most useful bird, for I rouse honest men to their work in the morning by my crowing."</seg>
<seg id="431">你会发现我是一只很有用的鸡，我会忠诚地在清晨叫醒人类。”</seg>
<seg id="432">But the Thief replied with some heat, "Yes, I know you do, making it still harder for us to get a livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="432">但是，小偷们回答说：“我当然知道你的作用了，就是因为你把人们都叫醒了，才让我们难以生存。</seg>
<seg id="433">Into the pot you go!"</seg>
<seg id="433">你就快点下油锅吧！”</seg>
<seg id="434">THE FARMER AND FORTUNE</seg>
<seg id="434">农夫和命运之神</seg>
<seg id="435">A Farmer was ploughing one day on his farm when he turned up a pot of golden coins with his plough.</seg>
<seg id="435">有个农夫在耕地时用犁耙出一坛金币，</seg>
<seg id="436">He was overjoyed at his discovery, and from that time forth made an offering daily at the shrine of the Goddess of the Earth.</seg>
<seg id="436">他欣喜若狂，从那之后，他每天都用丰富的供品来供奉土地爷。</seg>
<seg id="437">Fortune was displeased at this, and came to him and said, "My man, why do you give Earth the credit for the gift which I bestowed upon you?</seg>
<seg id="437">命运之神对此很生气，来到他面前，说：“喂，朋友，那坛金币是我送给你的礼物，你为什么要去供奉土地爷呢？</seg>
<seg id="438">You never thought of thanking me for your good luck;</seg>
<seg id="438">赋予你如此好的运气，你却从未想过感谢我；</seg>
<seg id="439">but should you be unlucky enough to lose what you have gained I know very well that I, Fortune, should then come in for all the blame."</seg>
<seg id="439">如果你运气不好，丢了本应属于你的东西，我敢保证，你一定会埋怨我这个命运之神了。”</seg>

<seg id="440">应该感恩时，一定要表现出来。</seg>
<seg id="441">JUPITER AND THE MONKEY</seg>
<seg id="441">朱庇特和猴子</seg>
<seg id="442">Jupiter issued a proclamation to all the beasts, and offered a prize to the one who, in his judgment, produced the most beautiful offspring.</seg>
<seg id="442">朱庇特通知森林中所有动物，要给那些他认为拥有最漂亮子孙的动物颁奖。</seg>
<seg id="443">Among the rest came the Monkey, carrying a baby monkey in her arms, a hairless, flat-nosed little fright.</seg>
<seg id="443">母猴怀里抱着一只扁鼻无毛、相貌丑陋的小猴子，与其它动物一起来到朱庇特那里参加评奖。</seg>
<seg id="444">When they saw it, the gods all burst into peal on peal of laughter;</seg>
<seg id="444">当大家看到那只小猴子时，发出一阵哄堂大笑。</seg>
<seg id="445">but the Monkey hugged her little one to her, and said, "Jupiter may give the prize to whomsoever he likes:</seg>
<seg id="445">但是，母猴却抱紧了自己的孩子，坚定地说：“朱庇特或许会奖励他最喜欢的那一个，</seg>
<seg id="446">but I shall always think my baby the most beautiful of them all."</seg>
<seg id="446">但是，我坚定地认为自己的孩子就是最最漂亮的那一个。”</seg>
<seg id="447">FATHER AND SONS</seg>
<seg id="447">父亲和儿子</seg>
<seg id="448">A certain man had several Sons who were always quarrelling with one another, and, try as he might, he could not get them to live together in harmony.</seg>
<seg id="448">有一个人生养了几个儿子，可是儿子们之间总爱争吵不休，父亲无论做什么，都无法使儿子们和睦相处。</seg>
<seg id="449">So he determined to convince them of their folly by the following means.</seg>
<seg id="449">于是，他决定用下面的方法来说服儿子们。</seg>
<seg id="450">Bidding them fetch a bundle of sticks, he invited each in turn to break it across his knee.</seg>
<seg id="450">他让儿子们取来一捆木棒，大家轮流试着用膝盖折断它们。</seg>
<seg id="451">All tried and all failed: and then he undid the bundle, and handed them the sticks one by one, when they had no difficulty at all in breaking them.</seg>
<seg id="451">几个儿子分别试了一下，可是都失败了。接着，他拆开那捆木棒，一根一根地交给儿子们，这时，他们便毫不费力地折断了木棒。</seg>
<seg id="452">"There, my boys," said he, "united you will be more than a match for your enemies:</seg>
<seg id="452">“看吧，我的孩子，”他说，“你们若能齐心协力，便可与敌人抗衡。</seg>
<seg id="453">but if you quarrel and separate, your weakness will put you at the mercy of those who attack you."</seg>

<seg id="454">Union is strength.</seg>
<seg id="454">团结就是力量。</seg>
<seg id="455">THE LAMP</seg>
<seg id="455">油灯</seg>
<seg id="456">A Lamp, well filled with oil, burned with a clear and steady light, and began to swell with pride and boast that it shone more brightly than the sun himself.</seg>
<seg id="456">有一盏装满油的油灯，在燃烧时发出了清晰稳定的亮光。油灯开始洋洋得意起来，以为自己发出的光比太阳光还要亮得多。</seg>
<seg id="457">Just then a puff of wind came and blew it out.</seg>
<seg id="457">就在这时，一阵风吹来，灯马上被吹灭了。</seg>
<seg id="458">Some one struck a match and lit it again, and said, "You just keep alight, and never mind the sun.</seg>
<seg id="458">有人过来又点燃了它，并说道：“你就好好亮着吧，永远不要去想太阳。为什么？</seg>
<seg id="459">Why, even the stars never need to be relit as you had to be just now."</seg>
<seg id="459">因为即便是星星，也不会像你刚才一样被风吹灭。”</seg>
<seg id="460">THE OWL AND THE BIRDS</seg>
<seg id="460">猫头鹰和百鸟</seg>
<seg id="461">The Owl is a very wise bird;</seg>
<seg id="461">猫头鹰是一种非常聪明的鸟。</seg>
<seg id="462">and once, long ago, when the first oak sprouted in the forest, she called all the other Birds together and said to them, "You see this tiny tree?</seg>
<seg id="462">很久以前，第一只猫头鹰开始在森林里扎根繁衍时，她召集起所有的鸟类，对他们说：“你们看到这棵小树了吗？</seg>
<seg id="463">If you take my advice, you will destroy it now when it is small:</seg>
<seg id="463">要是愿意听从我的建议，在它还没长成大树之前，就先毁掉它。</seg>
<seg id="464">for when it grows big, the mistletoe will appear upon it, from which birdlime will be prepared for your destruction."</seg>
<seg id="464">因为当它长成参天大树之后，就会出现槲寄生，继而你们就等着被专门捕鸟的粘圈毁灭吧。”</seg>
<seg id="465">Again, when the first flax was sown, she said to them, "Go and eat up that seed, for it is the seed of the flax, out of which men will one day make nets to catch you."</seg>
<seg id="465">当亚麻种子第一次出现在森林里时，她又对鸟儿们说：“去吃掉那些种子，因为这是亚麻种子，要是没有亚麻，人类就无法织网来捕鸟了。”</seg>
<seg id="466">Once more, when she saw the first archer, she warned the Birds that he was their deadly enemy, who would wing his arrows with their own feathers and shoot them.</seg>
<seg id="466">还有一次，当她第一次看到弓箭手时，就提醒鸟儿们注意这是它们的死敌，因为人们会用带有鸟类羽毛的箭来射死鸟类。</seg>
<seg id="467">But they took no notice of what she said:</seg>
<seg id="467">但是，鸟儿们并没有将她的话放在心上，</seg>
<seg id="468">in fact, they thought she was rather mad, and laughed at her.</seg>
<seg id="468">正相反，鸟儿们还嘲笑她是个疯子。</seg>
<seg id="469">When, however, everything turned out as she had foretold, they changed their minds and conceived a great respect for her wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="469">然而，当事实正如猫头鹰预言的那样依次出现时，鸟儿们开始改变自己的思想了，并且大大佩服并赞赏猫头鹰的智慧。</seg>
<seg id="470">Hence, whenever she appears, the Birds attend upon her in the hope of hearing something that may be for their good.</seg>
<seg id="470">由此，只要猫头鹰一出现，鸟儿们就会趋之若鹜，想听到一些对自己有益的忠言。</seg>
<seg id="471">She, however, gives them advice no longer, but sits moping and pondering on the folly of her kind.</seg>
<seg id="471">不过，猫头鹰已经不再提出忠告，而只是百无聊赖地坐在那里，沉浸在自己心中的遐想之中。</seg>
<seg id="472">THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN</seg>
<seg id="472">披着狮皮的驴</seg>
<seg id="473">An Ass found a Lion's Skin, and dressed himself up in it.</seg>
<seg id="473">一头驴发现了一张狮子的皮，于是就披到身上。</seg>
<seg id="474">Then he went about frightening every one he met, for they all took him to be a lion, men and beasts alike, and took to their heels when they saw him coming.</seg>
<seg id="474">他走出去吓唬其它动物，所有见到他的人和动物都把他当成了狮子，吓得四处逃跑。</seg>
<seg id="475">Elated by the success of his trick, he loudly brayed in triumph.</seg>
<seg id="475">驴见自己的诡计得逞了，兴奋地大叫起来。</seg>
<seg id="476">The Fox heard him, and recognised him at once for the Ass he was, and said to him, "Oho, my friend, it's you, is it?</seg>
<seg id="476">狐狸听到了他的声音，立刻认出这是一头驴，于是就对他说：“哦，朋友，这才是真正的你，是吗？</seg>
<seg id="477">I, too, should have been afraid if I hadn't heard your voice."</seg>
<seg id="477">要不是听到了你的声音，我也被你吓着了。”[突然一阵风刮来，把驴身上披着的狮皮吹走了，驴子原形毕露。这时，动物们见此情形，又都跑回来，用木板和棍棒狠狠地打他。]</seg>
<seg id="478">THE SHE-GOATS AND THEIR BEARDS</seg>
<seg id="478">母山羊和她们的胡须</seg>
<seg id="479">Jupiter granted beards to the She-Goats at their own request, much to the disgust of the he-Goats, who considered this to be an unwarrantable invasion of their rights and dignities.</seg>
<seg id="479">朱庇特答应了母山羊的请求，让她们也长出胡须，但是公山羊对此非常不高兴，抱怨女人无理侵犯他们的权利和尊严。</seg>
<seg id="480">So they sent a deputation to him to protest against his action.</seg>
<seg id="480">因此，为了反对这一举动，他们派出代表向朱庇特抗议。</seg>
<seg id="481">He, however, advised them not to raise any objections.</seg>
<seg id="481">不过，朱庇特劝他们不要提出任何异议。</seg>
<seg id="482">"What's in a tuft of hair?" said he. "Let them have it if they want it.</seg>
<seg id="482">“一绺毛发能算什么呢？”朱庇特说道，“如果她们想要，就让她们拥有吧。</seg>
<seg id="483">They can never be a match for you in strength."</seg>
<seg id="483">但是她们的力量永远无法与你们匹敌。”</seg>
<seg id="484">THE OLD LION</seg>
<seg id="484">老狮子</seg>
<seg id="485">A Lion, enfeebled by age and no longer able to procure food for himself by force, determined to do so by cunning.</seg>
<seg id="485">有一头上了年纪的狮子，已经不能凭借蛮力去抢夺食物了，暗自思忖着只能用智取的办法才能获得必要食物。</seg>
<seg id="486">Betaking himself to a cave, he lay down inside and feigned to be sick:</seg>
<seg id="486">于是，他钻进一个山洞里，躺在地上假装生病，</seg>
<seg id="487">and whenever any of the other animals entered to inquire after his health, he sprang upon them and devoured them.</seg>
<seg id="487">只要有其它小动物走过来窥探他的健康状况，他就会上前抓住他们，然后吃掉。</seg>
<seg id="488">Many lost their lives in this way, till one day a Fox called at the cave, and, having a suspicion of the truth, addressed the Lion from outside instead of going in, and asked him how he did.</seg>
<seg id="488">就这样，许多动物都丧失了性命。直到有一天，怀疑事实真相的狐狸识破了狮子的诡计，他远远地站在洞外，询问狮子现在感觉如何。</seg>
<seg id="489">He replied that he was in a very bad way:</seg>
<seg id="489">狮子回答说自己感觉很不好，</seg>
<seg id="490">"But," said he, "why do you stand outside?</seg>
<seg id="490">他问狐狸：“不过，你为什么站在外面问，</seg>
<seg id="491">Pray come in."</seg>

<seg id="494">一天，有个小男孩正在河里洗澡，他走到了水深没顶的地方，眼看就要被淹死了。</seg>
<seg id="495">A man who was passing along a road heard his cries for help, and went to the riverside and began to scold him for being so careless as to get into deep water, but made no attempt to help him.</seg>
<seg id="495">一个正经过此路的行人听到了男孩的呼救声，他走到河边，开始教训小男孩太鲁莽地进入深水区，但是并没有要去救人的意思。</seg>
<seg id="496">"Oh, sir," cried the Boy, "please help me first and scold me afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="496">小男孩大声喊道：“先生，拜托你，还是先把我救起来，再好好教训吧。”</seg>
<seg id="497">Give assistance, not advice, in a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="497">危急之中应伸出援手，而非建议。</seg>
<seg id="498">THE QUACK FROG</seg>
<seg id="498">庸医青蛙</seg>
<seg id="499">Once upon a time a Frog came forth from his home in the marshes and proclaimed to all the world that he was a learned physician, skilled in drugs and able to cure all diseases.</seg>
<seg id="499">从前，有一只青蛙从他那湿地中的家里蹦了出来，向所有的动物宣称自己是一个博学多才的医生，精通于药学，能治百病。</seg>
<seg id="500">Among the crowd was a Fox, who called out, "You a doctor!</seg>
<seg id="500">其中，有一只狐狸问他：“你这样的医生，</seg>
<seg id="501">Why, how can you set up to heal others when you cannot even cure your own lame legs and blotched and wrinkled skin?"</seg>
<seg id="501">连自己的跛足和斑驳起皱的皮都治不好，怎么还敢吹牛说能给别人治病呢？”</seg>
<seg id="502">Physician, heal thyself.</seg>
<seg id="502">要医人，先医己。</seg>
<seg id="503">THE SWOLLEN FOX</seg>
<seg id="503">胀肚的狐狸</seg>
<seg id="504">A hungry Fox found in a hollow tree a quantity of bread and meat, which some shepherds had placed there against their return.</seg>
<seg id="504">饥饿的狐狸在一棵中空的树干中发现了一些牧羊人存留的面包和肉。</seg>
<seg id="505">Delighted with his find he slipped in through the narrow aperture and greedily devoured it all.</seg>
<seg id="505">高兴之余，他立即通过那狭窄的缝隙挤进去，贪婪地大吃起来。</seg>
<seg id="506">But when he tried to get out again he found himself so swollen after his big meal that he could not squeeze through the hole, and fell to whining and groaning over his misfortune.</seg>
<seg id="506">然而，当他吃饱之后，却发现自己的肚子胀鼓鼓的，即便费了九牛二虎之力，却怎么也钻不出那个洞来，便在树洞里唉声叹气。</seg>
<seg id="507">Another Fox, happening to pass that way, came and asked him what the matter was;</seg>
<seg id="507">另一只狐狸恰巧经过那里，听到他的呻吟，便过去问他原因。</seg>
<seg id="508">and, on learning the state of the case, said, "Well, my friend, I see nothing for it but for you to stay where you are till you shrink to your former size;</seg>
<seg id="508">听明白缘由后，那只狐狸便说道：“我的朋友，你就老老实实待在里边吧，等到恢复了钻进去之前的身材，</seg>
<seg id="509">you'll get out then easily enough."</seg>
<seg id="509">你就能轻松地出来了。”</seg>
<seg id="510">THE MOUSE, THE FROG, AND THE HAWK</seg>
<seg id="510">老鼠、青蛙和老鹰</seg>
<seg id="511">A Mouse and a Frog struck up a friendship; they were not well mated, for the Mouse lived entirely on land, while the Frog was equally at home on land or in the water.</seg>
<seg id="511">一只老鼠与一只青蛙建立起了友谊。但是他们并非十分相配，因为老鼠完全生活在陆地上，而青蛙则除了陆地上的生活外，还时常在水中生活。</seg>
<seg id="512">In order that they might never be separated, the Frog tied himself and the Mouse together by the leg with a piece of thread.</seg>
<seg id="512">为了永远不分开，青蛙用一根绳子把自己的腿和老鼠的腿绑在了一起。</seg>
<seg id="513">As long as they kept on dry land all went fairly well;</seg>
<seg id="513">他们在干燥的地面上行走时，一切都正常，</seg>
<seg id="514">but, coming to the edge of a pool, the Frog jumped in, taking the Mouse with him, and began swimming about and croaking with pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="514">可是当他们来到池塘边时，青蛙带着老鼠一起跳进了水里，一边游泳，一边高兴得呱呱大叫。</seg>
<seg id="515">The unhappy Mouse, however, was soon drowned, and floated about on the surface in the wake of the Frog.</seg>
<seg id="515">然而，可怜的老鼠很快就被淹死了，并且尾随着青蛙漂浮在水面。</seg>
<seg id="516">There he was spied by a Hawk, who pounced down on him and seized him in his talons.</seg>
<seg id="516">这时，一只鹰发现了老鼠，猛然冲向水面，用鹰爪把他抓了起来。</seg>
<seg id="517">The Frog was unable to loose the knot which bound him to the Mouse, and thus was carried off along with him and eaten by the Hawk.</seg>
<seg id="517">青蛙无法松开与老鼠绑在一起的绳结，于是也一同被抓走，成了老鹰的美食。</seg>

<seg id="519">一个小男孩在篱笆丛中采集浆果，一不小心被荨麻刺伤了。</seg>
<seg id="520">Smarting with the pain, he ran to tell his mother, and said to her between his sobs, "I only touched it ever so lightly, mother."</seg>
<seg id="520">带着难受的刺痛感，他急忙跑回家，边哭边对妈妈说：“妈妈，我只是轻轻地碰了它一下。”</seg>
<seg id="521">"That's just why you got stung, my son," she said;</seg>
<seg id="521">妈妈说：“这就是你被刺痛的原因，我的儿子。</seg>
<seg id="522">"if you had grasped it firmly, it wouldn't have hurt you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="522">如果你勇敢地一把抓住它，就不会被刺伤了。”</seg>
<seg id="523">THE PEASANT AND THE APPLE-TREE</seg>
<seg id="523">农夫和苹果树</seg>
<seg id="524">A Peasant had an Apple-tree growing in his garden, which bore no fruit, but merely served to provide a shelter from the heat for the sparrows and grasshoppers which sat and chirped in its branches.</seg>
<seg id="524">有一个农夫，他的园子里有一棵苹果树，这棵树并不茂盛，只能为麻雀和蝉提供一个可栖息的地方，让他们坐在枝桠上歇息和喋喋不休地吵闹。</seg>
<seg id="525">Disappointed at its barrenness he determined to cut it down, and went and fetched his axe for the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="525">农夫认为这棵树没有什么大用处，决定把它砍掉，于是便拿起斧头走过去砍起树来。</seg>
<seg id="526">But when the sparrows and the grasshoppers saw what he was about to do, they begged him to spare it, and said to him, "If you destroy the tree we shall have to seek shelter elsewhere, and you will no longer have our merry chirping to enliven your work in the garden."</seg>
<seg id="526">然而，那些蝉和麻雀看到农夫的行为后，便请求农夫留下这棵树，并且对他说：“如果你砍掉这棵树，我们还得另外再找一个窝，而你也不会在园子里干活时听到我们为你鼓劲的欢快歌声了。”</seg>
<seg id="527">He, however, refused to listen to them, and set to work with a will to cut through the trunk.</seg>
<seg id="527">农夫没理睬他们，继续拿起斧头砍这棵树。</seg>
<seg id="528">A few strokes showed that it was hollow inside and contained a swarm of bees and a large store of honey.</seg>
<seg id="528">几斧下去之后，树上出现了一个洞，他发现树洞里有蜂巢和蜂蜜。</seg>
<seg id="529">Delighted with his find he threw down his axe, saying, "The old tree is worth keeping after all."</seg>
<seg id="529">他高兴地连忙抛下斧头，说：“这棵老树还真是值得保留下来。”</seg>
<seg id="530">Utility is most men's test of worth.</seg>
<seg id="530">实用性是大多数人对价值的检验。</seg>
<seg id="531">THE JACKDAW AND THE PIGEONS</seg>
<seg id="531">寒鸦与鸽子</seg>
<seg id="532">A Jackdaw, watching some Pigeons in a farmyard, was filled with envy when he saw how well they were fed, and determined to disguise himself as one of them, in order to secure a share of the good things they enjoyed.</seg>
<seg id="532">看见一群住在农场里的鸽子不愁吃喝，过着悠闲舒适的生活，一只寒鸦便心生嫉妒。为了能分享鸽子的食物，他决定将自己伪装成一只鸽子。</seg>
<seg id="533">So he painted himself white from head to foot and joined the flock;</seg>
<seg id="533">于是，寒鸦将自己的羽毛全都涂成白色，跑到鸽群中，</seg>
<seg id="534">and, so long as he was silent, they never suspected that he was not a pigeon like themselves.</seg>
<seg id="534">而且，寒鸦一直都保持着沉默，鸽子们从未怀疑过他不是一只鸽子。</seg>
<seg id="535">But one day he was unwise enough to start chattering, when they at once saw through his disguise and pecked him so unmercifully that he was glad to escape and join his own kind again.</seg>
<seg id="535">可是，有一天，他不小心发出了叫声，鸽子们立刻看穿了他的伪装，毫不留情地去啄他。寒鸦侥幸逃出了鸽群的袭击，回到同类之中。</seg>
<seg id="536">But the other jackdaws did not recognise him in his white dress, and would not let him feed with them, but drove him away:</seg>
<seg id="536">然而，因为他的毛色与以前不同了，所以其它寒鸦都没认出他来，也不让他参与集体生活，而且还赶他走。</seg>
<seg id="537">and so he became a homeless wanderer for his pains.</seg>
<seg id="537">就这样，这只寒鸦为了自己的贪心而成了无家可归的流浪汉。</seg>
<seg id="538">JUPITER AND THE TORTOISE</seg>
<seg id="538">朱庇特与乌龟</seg>
<seg id="539">Jupiter was about to marry a wife, and determined to celebrate the event by inviting all the animals to a banquet.</seg>
<seg id="539">朱庇特将要娶妻了，他决定举行盛大宴会，招待所有动物，以庆祝这件婚姻大事。</seg>
<seg id="540">They all came except the Tortoise, who did not put in an appearance, much to Jupiter's surprise.</seg>
<seg id="540">除了乌龟之外，所有动物都出席了，这让朱庇特大为吃惊。</seg>
<seg id="541">So when he next saw the Tortoise he asked him why he had not been at the banquet.</seg>
<seg id="541">于是，当他再次见到乌龟时，便问他为什么没来赴宴。</seg>
<seg id="542">"I don't care for going out," said the Tortoise; "there's no place like home."</seg>
<seg id="542">“我不喜欢出门，”乌龟回答说，“哪里也不如自己的家里舒服。”</seg>
<seg id="543">Jupiter was so much annoyed by this reply that he decreed that from that time forth the Tortoise should carry his house upon his back, and never be able to get away from home even if he wished to.</seg>
<seg id="543">朱庇特听到乌龟的回答很生气，于是就下令，从此让乌龟永远驮着他的家行走，即便想卸下来都不行。</seg>
<seg id="544">THE DOG IN THE MANGER</seg>
<seg id="544">狗占牛槽</seg>
<seg id="545">A Dog was lying in a Manger on the hay which had been put there for the cattle, and when they came and tried to eat, he growled and snapped at them and wouldn't let them get at their food.</seg>
<seg id="545">一条狗躺在牛吃草的饲料槽中，而狗身下的草正是为牛准备的食料。当牛向着牛槽走过去，准备吃草时，狗不仅冲着他们大吼大叫，而且还抓咬他们，不让牛吃干草。</seg>
<seg id="546">"What a selfish beast," said one of them to his companions;</seg>
<seg id="546">“这条狗太自私了！”其中一头牛对同伴说，</seg>
<seg id="547">"he can't eat himself and yet he won't let those eat who can."</seg>
<seg id="547">“他自己不能吃干草，还不让能吃的去吃。”</seg>

<seg id="549">每个人生来都带着两个口袋，一个在前，一个在后，两个口袋里都满载缺点。</seg>
<seg id="550">The Bag in front contains his neighbours' faults, the one behind his own.</seg>
<seg id="550">前面那只口袋里装的是别人的缺点，而后面那只口袋里则装的是自己的缺点。</seg>
<seg id="551">Hence it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to see those of others.</seg>
<seg id="551">因此，人们总是看不见自己的缺点，却永远不会忽视去看别人的缺点。</seg>
<seg id="552">THE OXEN AND THE AXLETREES</seg>
<seg id="552">公牛和车轴</seg>
<seg id="553">A pair of Oxen were drawing a heavily loaded waggon along the highway, and, as they tugged and strained at the yoke, the Axletrees creaked and groaned terribly.</seg>
<seg id="553">几头公牛正用劲拉着超重的货车在大路上行走，当他们用劲拖拉货车和牛轭时，车轴被压得吱吱作响。</seg>
<seg id="554">This was too much for the Oxen, who turned round indignantly and said, "Hullo, you there!</seg>
<seg id="554">牛有点不耐烦了，回过头对车轴说道：“喂，朋友，</seg>
<seg id="555">Why do you make such a noise when we do all the work?"</seg>
<seg id="555">我们正在努力地干活，你叫唤什么？”</seg>

<seg id="558">一个小男孩把手伸进装满榛子的瓶中，用尽全力去抓了一大把。</seg>
<seg id="559">But when he tried to pull it out again, he found he couldn't do so, for the neck of the jar was too small to allow of the passage of so large a handful.</seg>
<seg id="559">但当他想要缩回手时，却发现根本出不来，因为相对于他那抓满榛子的手来说，瓶口太小了。</seg>
<seg id="560">Unwilling to lose his nuts but unable to withdraw his hand, he burst into tears.</seg>
<seg id="560">他既不想放弃手中的一部分榛子，又不能拿出手来，于是大哭起来。</seg>
<seg id="561">A bystander, who saw where the trouble lay, said to him, "Come, my boy, don't be so greedy:</seg>
<seg id="561">一个旁观者看出了他的麻烦，便对他说：“孩子，不要太贪婪，</seg>

<seg id="565">因为缺少一个统领者，青蛙们大为不悦。</seg>
<seg id="566">so they sent a deputation to Jupiter to ask him to give them a King.</seg>
<seg id="566">于是，他们派了一个代表去拜见朱庇特，请求赐给他们一个国王。</seg>
<seg id="567">Jupiter, despising the folly of their request, cast a log into the pool where they lived, and said that that should be their King.</seg>
<seg id="567">朱庇特不屑于他们如此愚蠢的请求，便将一根木头扔到青蛙居住的池塘中，并且说这就是他们的国王。</seg>
<seg id="568">The Frogs were terrified at first by the splash, and scuttled away into the deepest parts of the pool;</seg>
<seg id="568">刚听到木头落下的声音时，青蛙们都吓了一大跳，纷纷潜入池塘深处；</seg>
<seg id="569">but by and by, when they saw that the log remained motionless, one by one they ventured to the surface again, and before long, growing bolder, they began to feel such contempt for it that they even took to sitting upon it.</seg>
<seg id="569">没过多久，当他们发现木头依旧静止在那里时，一个接一个地又游出水面来；不久之后，他们愈发大胆了，发现木头没什么了不起的，甚至于爬上木块，坐在它的上面。</seg>
<seg id="570">Thinking that a King of that sort was an insult to their dignity, they sent to Jupiter a second time, and begged him to take away the sluggish King he had given them, and to give them another and a better one.</seg>
<seg id="570">他们认为这样一个国王简直是对自己尊严的侮辱，于是又去求见朱庇特，请求把赐予他们的这个木头疙瘩拿走，再换一个更好的国王。</seg>
<seg id="571">Jupiter, annoyed at being pestered in this way, sent a Stork to rule over them, who no sooner arrived among them than he began to catch and eat the Frogs as fast as he could.</seg>
<seg id="571">朱庇特对此十分生气，便派了一只鹳去管制青蛙。结果，鹳一来到池塘里，便开始全力逮吃青蛙。</seg>

<seg id="575">whereas I, as you see, remain green and flourishing all the year round."</seg>
<seg id="575">而我的叶子就像你看到的这样，一年四季都是常青的。”</seg>
<seg id="576">Soon afterwards there came a heavy fall of snow, which settled on the leaves of the Olive so that she bent and broke under the weight;</seg>
<seg id="576">正当他夸夸其谈时，突然下起了大雪，雪花全都压在橄榄树的叶子上，不一会儿就把他压垮了；</seg>
<seg id="577">but the flakes fell harmlessly through the bare branches of the Fig, which survived to bear many another crop.</seg>

<seg id="582">就在他们喘气休息时，忽然回过头去，看见几只秃鹰正坐在岩石上，显然他们正在等着看谁先败下阵来，接着就会冲过来吃掉那个尸体。</seg>

<seg id="588">人和同行的狮子</seg>

<seg id="590">就这样面红耳赤地争吵着，他们来到了一个十字路口，看到塑像上雕刻着一个人征服几头狮子的场景。</seg>
<seg id="591">"There!" said the Man triumphantly, "look at that!</seg>

<seg id="598">一只乌龟，不满足于自己的地面生活，很羡慕鸟儿能在空中玩耍，于是便请求老鹰教他飞翔。</seg>
<seg id="599">The Eagle protested that it was idle for him to try, as nature had not provided him with wings;</seg>
<seg id="599">老鹰劝他，这是他的一个白日梦，因为大自然并没有赋予他可以飞翔的翅膀。</seg>
<seg id="600">but the Tortoise pressed him with entreaties and promises of treasure, insisting that it could only be a question of learning the craft of the air.</seg>
<seg id="600">可是乌龟再三恳求，还用珍宝利诱老鹰，一再坚持这只是一个了解如何在空中飞翔的问题。</seg>
<seg id="601">So at length the Eagle consented to do the best he could for him, and picked him up in his talons.</seg>
<seg id="601">于是，老鹰为了满足乌龟的愿望，一把抓起他，</seg>
<seg id="602">Soaring with him to a great height in the sky he then let him go, and the wretched Tortoise fell headlong and was dashed to pieces on a rock.</seg>

<seg id="609">有一只狐狸曾经落入捕兽器的圈套，经过一番斗争，他终于逃脱了，但却失去了一条尾巴。</seg>
<seg id="610">He was then so much ashamed of his appearance that he thought life was not worth living unless he could persuade the other Foxes to part with their tails also, and thus divert attention from his own loss.</seg>
<seg id="610">经此劫难，他觉得自己脸上无光，还不如一死了之，除非能够劝说其它狐狸也舍弃自己的尾巴，这样大家就不会再关注他的断尾了。</seg>
<seg id="611">So he called a meeting of all the Foxes, and advised them to cut off their tails:</seg>
<seg id="611">于是他召集了所有狐狸开会，劝说他们也割掉自己的尾巴，</seg>
<seg id="612">"They're ugly things anyhow," he said, "and besides they're heavy, and it's tiresome to be always carrying them about with you."</seg>
<seg id="612">他当众宣称：“你们的尾巴实在太难看了，一直带着尾巴四处走，这简直太让人厌恶了。”</seg>
<seg id="613">But one of the other Foxes said, "My friend, if you hadn't lost your own tail, you wouldn't be so keen on getting us to cut off ours."</seg>
<seg id="613">然而，有一只狐狸站出来反驳道：“喂，朋友，如果你没有丢掉自己的尾巴，就不会这样煞费苦心地来劝说我们了。”</seg>
<seg id="614">THE VAIN JACKDAW</seg>
<seg id="614">爱慕虚荣的寒鸦</seg>
<seg id="615">Jupiter announced that he intended to appoint a king over the birds, and named a day on which they were to appear before his throne, when he would select the most beautiful of them all to be their ruler.</seg>
<seg id="615">朱庇特想在鸟类中指定一个王，便指定了一个日子，令百鸟全都按时出席，届时他将挑选其中最美丽的鸟为百鸟之王。</seg>
<seg id="616">Wishing to look their best on the occasion they repaired to the banks of a stream, where they busied themselves in washing and preening their feathers.</seg>
<seg id="616">为了展现自己最好的一面，众鸟都跑到河里忙于梳理自己的羽毛。</seg>
<seg id="617">The Jackdaw was there along with the rest, and realised that, with his ugly plumage, he would have no chance of being chosen as he was:</seg>
<seg id="617">像那些有自知之明的鸟一样，寒鸦也意识到自己的丑陋，根本不可能被选为百鸟之王，</seg>
<seg id="618">so he waited till they were all gone, and then picked up the most gaudy of the feathers they had dropped, and fastened them about his own body, with the result that he looked gayer than any of them.</seg>
<seg id="618">于是他在河边等着众鸟散去，捡起他们脱落下的羽毛，小心翼翼地全固定在自己身上，结果他看上去比其它鸟都华丽。</seg>
<seg id="619">When the appointed day came, the birds assembled before Jupiter's throne;</seg>
<seg id="619">指定的日子来临了，众鸟都来到朱庇特的王位前。</seg>
<seg id="620">and, after passing them in review, he was about to make the Jackdaw king, when all the rest set upon the king-elect, stripped him of his borrowed plumes, and exposed him for the Jackdaw that he was.</seg>
<seg id="620">浏览了一遍眼前的众鸟，朱庇特决定立寒鸦为王。为了王位大选而来的其它鸟，纷纷从寒鸦身上拔下本属于自己的羽毛，暴露出寒鸦那丑陋的本来面目。</seg>
<seg id="621">THE TRAVELLER AND HIS DOG</seg>
<seg id="621">旅人和他的狗</seg>
<seg id="622">A Traveller was about to start on a journey, and said to his Dog, who was stretching himself by the door, "Come, what are you yawning for?</seg>
<seg id="622">有一个人正准备踏上一段旅途，于是对正在门口站着打呵欠的狗说：“你还站在那里打什么呵欠呀？</seg>
<seg id="623">Hurry up and get ready:</seg>
<seg id="623">快点过来，一切都准备好了，</seg>
<seg id="624">I mean you to go with me."</seg>
<seg id="624">就差你跟我走了！”</seg>
<seg id="625">But the Dog merely wagged his tail and said quietly, "I'm ready, master:</seg>
<seg id="625">但是，狗却摇着尾巴，静静地回答说：“我早就准备好了，</seg>
<seg id="626">it's you I'm waiting for."</seg>
<seg id="626">倒是一直在等你呢。”</seg>
<seg id="627">THE SHIPWRECKED MAN AND THE SEA</seg>
<seg id="627">遇难者与海</seg>
<seg id="628">A Shipwrecked Man cast up on the beach fell asleep after his struggle with the waves.</seg>
<seg id="628">一个遇上海难的人经过一番风浪里的挣扎，终于被冲上岸，他筋疲力尽地躺在沙滩上睡着了。</seg>
<seg id="629">When he woke up, he bitterly reproached the Sea for its treachery in enticing men with its smooth and smiling surface, and then, when they were well embarked, turning in fury upon them and sending both ship and sailors to destruction.</seg>
<seg id="629">不一会儿，当他醒过来后，便开始指责大海总以平静、温和的外表引诱人们，然而，就在人们上当受骗之后，大海就变得凶暴和残忍，最终致使船和船上的人同归于尽。</seg>
<seg id="630">The Sea arose in the form of a woman, and replied, "Lay not the blame on me, O sailor, but on the Winds.</seg>
<seg id="630">这时，大海以女人的形象出现了，并且对他说：“喂，朋友，你别责怪我，应该责怪风！</seg>
<seg id="631">By nature I am as calm and safe as the land itself:</seg>
<seg id="631">我本是平静的，</seg>
<seg id="632">but the Winds fall upon me with their gusts and gales, and lash me into a fury that is not natural to me."</seg>
<seg id="632">但是只要风猛然刮过来，就会掀起惊涛骇浪，使我变得残暴。这并不是我的本性。”</seg>
<seg id="633">THE WILD BOAR AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="633">野猪与狐狸</seg>
<seg id="634">A Wild Boar was engaged in whetting his tusks upon the trunk of a tree in the forest when a Fox came by and, seeing what he was at, said to him, "Why are you doing that, pray?</seg>
<seg id="634">一头野猪在森林里的一棵树干上磨他的牙齿，这时，狐狸走过来，看到野猪在磨牙，便不解地问道：“你在做什么，祈祷吗？</seg>
<seg id="635">The huntsmen are not out to-day, and there are no other dangers at hand that I can see."</seg>
<seg id="635">今天猎人没出来，我也没看到有什么危险来临呀。”</seg>
<seg id="636">"True, my friend," replied the Boar, "but the instant my life is in danger I shall need to use my tusks.</seg>
<seg id="636">“的确如此，我的朋友，”野猪回答说，“不过，一旦危险降临，我就可以利用磨好的利牙了。</seg>
<seg id="637">There'll be no time to sharpen them then."</seg>
<seg id="637">那时根本没有工夫再来磨牙了。”</seg>
<seg id="638">MERCURY AND THE SCULPTOR</seg>
<seg id="638">墨丘利与雕刻家</seg>
<seg id="639">Mercury was very anxious to know in what estimation he was held by mankind;</seg>
<seg id="639">墨丘利急于了解自己有多么受人尊重，</seg>
<seg id="640">so he disguised himself as a man and walked into a Sculptor's studio, where there were a number of statues finished and ready for sale.</seg>
<seg id="640">便化做一个凡人，来到一个雕刻家的工作室，那里有很多已经完工的雕像正待出售。</seg>
<seg id="641">Seeing a statue of Jupiter among the rest, he inquired the price of it.</seg>
<seg id="641">他看见了一尊朱庇特的雕像，便问要多少钱。</seg>
<seg id="642">"A crown," said the Sculptor.</seg>
<seg id="642">“一块银元。”雕刻家回答说。</seg>
<seg id="643">"Is that all?" said he, laughing;</seg>
<seg id="643">“就这么多？”他笑着问，</seg>
<seg id="644">"and" (pointing to one of Juno) "how much is that one?"</seg>
<seg id="644">“那么，”（他指着朱诺的像——朱庇特的妻子）“这一尊要多少钱？”</seg>
<seg id="645">"That," was the reply, "is half a crown."</seg>
<seg id="645">雕刻家回答说：“那个要半块银元。”</seg>
<seg id="646">"And how much might you be wanting for that one over there, now?" he continued, pointing to a statue of himself.</seg>
<seg id="646">“那边那个雕像，你想卖多少钱呢？”他指着自己的雕像继续问道。</seg>
<seg id="647">"That one?" said the Sculptor;</seg>
<seg id="647">“那个？”雕刻家说，</seg>
<seg id="648">"Oh, I'll throw him in for nothing if you'll buy the other two."</seg>
<seg id="648">“假如你要买那两个的话，我便把这个白送给你。”</seg>

<seg id="649">小鹿和妈妈</seg>
<seg id="650">A Hind said to her Fawn, who was now well grown and strong, "My son, Nature has given you a powerful body and a stout pair of horns, and I can't think why you are such a coward as to run away from the hounds."</seg>
<seg id="650">一只母鹿对已经长大了的小鹿说：“我的儿子，自然赋予了你健硕的体魄和一对结实的鹿角，我简直想不到，你为何这么胆小，竟然会从猎狗身边逃跑。”</seg>
<seg id="651">Just then they both heard the sound of a pack in full cry, but at a considerable distance.</seg>
<seg id="651">就在这时，母子俩都听到了远处一群猎狗的狂吠声。</seg>
<seg id="652">"You stay where you are," said the Hind; "never mind me":</seg>
<seg id="652">“你就待在原地吧，”母鹿说，“不要管我。”</seg>
<seg id="653">and with that she ran off as fast as her legs could carry her.</seg>
<seg id="653">话音刚落，她就飞也似的跑了。</seg>
<seg id="654">THE FOX AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="654">狐狸和狮子</seg>
<seg id="655">A Fox who had never seen a Lion one day met one, and was so terrified at the sight of him that he was ready to die with fear.</seg>
<seg id="655">有一天，从来没有见过狮子的一只狐狸第一次碰见了狮子，刚看见狮子的一刹那，狐狸竟被吓得半死。</seg>
<seg id="656">After a time he met him again, and was still rather frightened, but not nearly so much as he had been when he met him first.</seg>
<seg id="656">没过多久，他又一次遇到了狮子，仍然很害怕，但是已经不像第一次见到时那样了。</seg>
<seg id="657">But when he saw him for the third time he was so far from being afraid that he went up to him and began to talk to him as if he had known him all his life.</seg>
<seg id="657">然而，当狐狸第三次遇到狮子时，他竟有胆量走上前去与狮子交谈，仿佛老朋友一样。</seg>

<seg id="658">鹰与捕鹰者</seg>
<seg id="659">A Man once caught an Eagle, and after clipping his wings turned him loose among the fowls in his hen-house, where he moped in a corner, looking very dejected and forlorn.</seg>
<seg id="659">从前，有一个人捉住了一只鹰，随后便剪断了他的翅膀，放入鸡窝中与其它家禽一起饲养，鹰一直待在角落里暗自悲伤，看上去甚为沮丧和绝望。</seg>
<seg id="660">After a while his Captor was glad enough to sell him to a neighbour, who took him home and let his wings grow again.</seg>
<seg id="660">没过多久，捕获老鹰的那个人很高兴地将鹰卖给了一个邻居，邻居把鹰带回家后又帮他长出了新的翅膀。</seg>
<seg id="661">As soon as he had recovered the use of them, the Eagle flew out and caught a hare, which he brought home and presented to his benefactor.</seg>
<seg id="661">鹰飞出去抓住一只兔子，立刻带回家给恩人。</seg>
<seg id="662">A fox observed this, and said to the Eagle, "Don't waste your gifts on him!</seg>
<seg id="662">一只狐狸看到后，便对老鹰说：“不要在他身上浪费你的猎物！</seg>
<seg id="663">Go and give them to the man who first caught you; make him your friend, and then perhaps he won't catch you and clip your wings a second time."</seg>
<seg id="663">把这份礼物送给以前捕获你的那个人，和他交个朋友，那么，或许他不会再次捕获你，并剪断你的翅膀。”</seg>
<seg id="664">THE BLACKSMITH AND HIS DOG</seg>
<seg id="664">铁匠与小狗</seg>

<seg id="665">铁匠家有一条小狗，小狗常常在主人打铁时睡觉，但是一到了吃饭时间，便异常清醒起来。</seg>
<seg id="666">One day his master pretended to be disgusted at this, and when he had thrown him a bone as usual, he said, "What on earth is the good of a lazy cur like you?</seg>
<seg id="666">有一天，铁匠假装对此很生气，一边像往常一样扔给小狗一块骨头，一边说：“地球上还有像你一样懒惰的坏蛋吗？</seg>
<seg id="667">When I am hammering away at my anvil, you just curl up and go to sleep:</seg>
<seg id="667">你这家伙，总是在我卖力工作时，蜷缩起来睡觉，</seg>
<seg id="668">but no sooner do I stop for a mouthful of food than you wake up and wag your tail to be fed."</seg>

<seg id="671">一只非常口渴的鹿，跑到池塘边去喝水。</seg>
<seg id="672">As he bent over the surface he saw his own reflection in the water, and was struck with admiration for his fine spreading antlers, but at the same time he felt nothing but disgust for the weakness and slenderness of his legs.</seg>
<seg id="672">当他在池边俯下身去喝水时，看到了水面上自己的倒影，一边得意洋洋地欣赏着自己那完美修长的鹿角，一边又为自己的小细腿而闷闷不乐。</seg>
<seg id="673">While he stood there looking at himself, he was seen and attacked by a Lion;</seg>
<seg id="673">正当他看得入神时，被一头看见他的狮子袭击了。</seg>
<seg id="674">but in the chase which ensued, he soon drew away from his pursuer, and kept his lead as long as the ground over which he ran was open and free of trees.</seg>
<seg id="674">他拼命地向着空旷、没有树木的平原跑去，很快就摆脱了身后的追逐者。</seg>
<seg id="675">But coming presently to a wood, he was caught by his antlers in the branches, and fell a victim to the teeth and claws of his enemy.</seg>
<seg id="675">可是，当他跑进一片树林中时，眼看着那美丽的鹿角就被挂在了树枝上，终于被跟踪而来的敌人擒获，成了狮子的美味佳肴。</seg>
<seg id="676">"Woe is me!" he cried with his last breath;</seg>
<seg id="676">“真是不幸呀！”鹿在临死前哀叹道，</seg>
<seg id="677">"I despised my legs, which might have saved my life:</seg>
<seg id="677">“我小瞧了自己的腿，可是它们却救了我的命；</seg>

<seg id="681">一条狗嘴里叼着一块肉，在穿过小河上的一个木板桥时，碰巧看见了水中自己的倒影。</seg>
<seg id="682">He thought it was another dog with a piece of meat twice as big;</seg>
<seg id="682">他以为是另一条狗叼着一块更大的肉，</seg>
<seg id="683">so he let go his own, and flew at the other dog to get the larger piece.</seg>
<seg id="683">于是，他扑到水中，想去抢另一条狗嘴里那块更大的肉。</seg>
<seg id="684">But, of course, all that happened was that he got neither;</seg>
<seg id="684">然而，他最终什么也没有得到。</seg>
<seg id="685">for one was only a shadow, and the other was carried away by the current.</seg>
<seg id="685">因为水中那块肉本来就只是个影子，而原来的那块肉也被河水冲走了。</seg>
<seg id="686">MERCURY AND THE TRADESMEN</seg>
<seg id="686">墨丘利与商人</seg>
<seg id="687">When Jupiter was creating man, he told Mercury to make an infusion of lies, and to add a little of it to the other ingredients which went to the making of the Tradesmen.</seg>
<seg id="687">朱庇特在创造人类时，吩咐墨丘利制造一点让人说谎的药，并添加到其他要素上，从而形成商人。</seg>
<seg id="688">Mercury did so, and introduced an equal amount into each in turn--the tallow-chandler, and the greengrocer, and the haberdasher, and all, till he came to the horse-dealer, who was last on the list, when, finding that he had a quantity of the infusion still left, he put it all into him.</seg>
<seg id="688">墨丘利遵命研制好药之后，依次平均地添加到每种生意人身上——卖蜡烛的商贩、卖蔬菜瓜果的商贩、卖杂货的商贩等。最后轮到了马贩子，这是最后一个要添药的商人了，但是墨丘利却发现还剩下很多药，于是，他便将剩余的药全部加在了马贩子身上。</seg>
<seg id="689">This is why all Tradesmen lie more or less, but they none of them lie like a horse-dealer.</seg>
<seg id="689">这正是商人多少都会说谎的原因，尤其是马贩子更为厉害。</seg>
<seg id="690">THE MICE AND THE WEASELS</seg>
<seg id="690">老鼠和黄鼠狼</seg>
<seg id="691">There was war between the Mice and the Weasels, in which the Mice always got the worst of it, numbers of them being killed and eaten by the Weasels.</seg>
<seg id="691">老鼠和黄鼠狼打起仗来，老鼠每次都处于劣势，大量老鼠都被黄鼠狼杀死并吃掉了。</seg>
<seg id="692">So they called a council of war, in which an old Mouse got up and said, "It's no wonder we are always beaten, for we have no generals to plan our battles and direct our movements in the field."</seg>
<seg id="692">于是，他们召开了一次战事会议，其中，一个年长的老鼠站起来发言：“毫无疑问，我们总是被打败的一方，因为没有统领来规划我们的战斗，在战场上指挥我们的行动，所以才会屡次失败。”</seg>
<seg id="693">Acting on his advice, they chose the biggest Mice to be their leaders, and these, in order to be distinguished from the rank and file, provided themselves with helmets bearing large plumes of straw.</seg>
<seg id="693">根据他的建议，老鼠们推选出那些个头大的老鼠作为带队将领，并且，为了在老鼠群中区分这些将领，还让他们戴上用草编成的头盔。</seg>
<seg id="694">They then led out the Mice to battle, confident of victory:</seg>
<seg id="694">然后，老鼠带着必胜的信心再次投入到战斗中。</seg>
<seg id="695">but they were defeated as usual, and were soon scampering as fast as they could to their holes.</seg>
<seg id="695">可是，他们依旧被打败了，鼠群纷纷逃回洞中。</seg>
<seg id="696">All made their way to safety without difficulty except the leaders, who were so hampered by the badges of their rank that they could not get into their holes, and fell easy victims to their pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="696">除了那些将领之外，所有老鼠都轻易地逃进了洞里，因为头盔妨碍他们钻进小小的老鼠洞，所以将领们都被黄鼠狼吃掉了。</seg>
<seg id="697">Greatness carries its own penalties.</seg>
<seg id="697">伟大的形象也要付出代价。</seg>
<seg id="698">THE PEACOCK AND JUNO</seg>

<seg id="701">but whenever I utter a sound I become a laughing-stock."</seg>
<seg id="701">“但是，只要我一开口发声，就成了大家的笑料。”</seg>
<seg id="702">The goddess tried to console him by saying, "You have not, it is true, the power of song, but then you far excel all the rest in beauty:</seg>
<seg id="702">女神朱诺为了尽量安慰她，说道：“你的确没有唱歌的优势，但是你却有着超凡的美丽外表。</seg>
<seg id="703">your neck flashes like the emerald and your splendid tail is a marvel of gorgeous colour."</seg>
<seg id="703">你的脖子闪耀着绿宝石一样的光辉，你那开屏的尾巴更是华丽富贵、光彩照人。”</seg>
<seg id="704">But the Peacock was not appeased.</seg>
<seg id="704">然而，孔雀仍旧不满足。</seg>
<seg id="705">"What is the use," said he, "of being beautiful, with a voice like mine?"</seg>
<seg id="705">“我的声音那么难听，”孔雀说，“美丽又有什么用呀？”</seg>
<seg id="706">Then Juno replied, with a shade of sternness in her tones, "Fate has allotted to all their destined gifts: to yourself beauty, to the eagle strength, to the nightingale song, and so on to all the rest in their degree;</seg>
<seg id="706">朱诺接着回答说：“命运赋予了每个人不同的礼物——赋予了你无比的美丽，赋予了老鹰强大的力量，赋予了夜莺优美的歌声，以此类推下去，所有生命都有着各自的特征，</seg>
<seg id="707">but you alone are dissatisfied with your portion.</seg>
<seg id="707">而你却不满足于自己所拥有的。</seg>
<seg id="708">Make, then, no more complaints.</seg>
<seg id="708">不要再抱怨了，</seg>
<seg id="709">For, if your present wish were granted, you would quickly find cause for fresh discontent."</seg>

<seg id="713">A Fox, who heard him talking in this strain, smiled and said, "My friend, when you are hungry, I only wish you would confine your attention to the dead and leave the living alone."</seg>
<seg id="713">一只狐狸听到这些话，面带微笑地对熊说：“我的朋友，当你饥饿难耐时，我希望你也能将注意力集中在死人身上，不再吃活人了！”</seg>

<seg id="718">"Or else," said he, "we shall both be captured by the enemy."</seg>
<seg id="718">“否则，”他说，“我们便会被敌人逮住。”</seg>
<seg id="719">But the Ass just looked round lazily and said, "And if so, do you think they'll make me carry heavier loads than I have to now?"</seg>
<seg id="719">驴只是懒懒地看了看，便说：“如果这样的话，你不认为他们会让我驮更重的东西？”</seg>
<seg id="720">"No," said his master.</seg>

<seg id="727">“巨型兽？</seg>
<seg id="728">Was he as big as this?" said the Frog, puffing herself out to look as big as possible.</seg>
<seg id="728">是不是这么大？”青蛙妈妈一边问，一边尽力鼓气，让自己尽量变大一些。</seg>
<seg id="729">"Oh! yes, much bigger," was the answer.</seg>
<seg id="729">“嗯，是的，比这还要大。”小青蛙说。</seg>
<seg id="730">The Frog puffed herself out still more. "Was he as big as this?" said she.</seg>
<seg id="730">青蛙妈妈再鼓了鼓气，问道：“是不是这般大小呢？”</seg>

<seg id="736">持续了相当一段时间后，他依旧像过去那样贫穷。有一天，这个人带着极度的愤怒抓起神像，用尽全力冲着墙壁扔过去。</seg>

<seg id="741">有一个车夫驾着一辆载着货物的马车，正当他沿着乡间小路前进时，车轮突然深陷入泥坑中，拉车的马无论如何也挪不出车轮来。</seg>
<seg id="742">As he stood there, looking helplessly on, and calling loudly at intervals upon Hercules for assistance, the god himself appeared, and said to him, "Put your shoulder to the wheel, man, and goad on your horses, and then you may call on Hercules to assist you.</seg>
<seg id="742">车夫站在那里，无助地四处观望，大声呼喊着大力神前来帮忙。大力神赫刺克勒斯终于出现了，对他说：“先用你的肩膀顶住车轮，再用鞭子赶你的马，试着这样做了之后，再来祈求我的帮助。</seg>
<seg id="743">If you won't lift a finger to help yourself, you can't expect Hercules or any one else to come to your aid."</seg>
<seg id="743">如果你不能先自助，就不能期望大力神或其他人来帮你了。”</seg>

<seg id="747">愤怒的话语相继从他们的嘴里脱口而出，激烈的争吵马上就要升级了，这时，野蔷薇嬉皮笑脸地从隔壁篱笆丛中探出头来，说：“够了，朋友们，</seg>

<seg id="751">经过一场苦斗，双方都受了重伤，有气无力地躺在地上。</seg>

<seg id="752">一只狐狸早已躲在远处观望着，一见他们俩都直挺挺地躺在地上虚弱地一动不动，他便溜过去抓起羊羔，一溜烟地跑掉了。</seg>

<seg id="756">其中一个士兵马上逃跑了，另一个则勇敢地握着剑立在原地，强盗不得不弃他而逃。</seg>

<seg id="758">让我来对付他，我要让他知道面对的是什么人。”</seg>
<seg id="759">But the other replied, "You are a little late, my friend:</seg>
<seg id="759">然而，那名勇敢的士兵说：“你来晚了，我的朋友。</seg>
<seg id="760">I only wish you had backed me up just now, even if you had done no more than speak, for I should have been encouraged, believing your words to be true.</seg>
<seg id="760">要是你刚才能来帮我就好了，即便只是嘴上这样说也好，因为我会受到你这番话的鼓舞，并且相信这些话都是真的。</seg>
<seg id="761">As it is, calm yourself, and put up your sword: there is no further use for it.</seg>
<seg id="761">而现在，还是请你把剑收好，已经没有必要再用它了。</seg>
<seg id="762">You may delude others into thinking you're as brave as a lion:</seg>

<seg id="786">As no one offered to buy it, however, he thought he would try to attract a purchaser by proclaiming the virtues of the Image.</seg>
<seg id="786">因为没有一个买主前来光顾，他便认为自己应该大声叫喊，以此吸引人前来购买。</seg>
<seg id="787">So he cried up and down the market, "A god for sale! a god for sale!</seg>

<seg id="788">One who'll bring you luck and keep you lucky!"</seg>
<seg id="788">一个能给你带来好运并维持好运的神像！”</seg>

<seg id="789">这时，旁边的一个人对他说：“喂，朋友，如果你的神像真如你所说，那你为何不自己留下他，好好享受他给你的好运呢？”</seg>

<seg id="800">制皮匠一直在拖延，富人重复说了好多次让他快点搬家，皮匠每次总是说马上就搬，却老是不采取行动。</seg>

<seg id="828">At last she said, "You make a great nuisance of yourself at night by crowing and keeping people awake:</seg>
<seg id="828">最后，猫说：“你总在夜晚打鸣，让人们不能好好睡觉，</seg>
<seg id="829">so I am going to make an end of you."</seg>
<seg id="829">所以，我要吃掉你。”</seg>
<seg id="830">But the Cock defended himself by saying that he crowed in order that men might wake up and set about the day's work in good time, and that they really couldn't very well do without him.</seg>
<seg id="830">但是，公鸡却辩解说，自己为了人们的利益而叫醒他们，可使人们按时起床工作，若是没有了鸡，人们就无法准时起床工作了。</seg>
<seg id="831">"That may be," said the Cat, "but whether they can or not, I'm not going without my dinner";</seg>
<seg id="831">“有点道理，”猫回答说，“不过，不管他们能不能准时开始工作，我总不能没有饭吃。”</seg>

<seg id="837">“总有一天我会和你赛跑，并且还能赢了你。”</seg>
<seg id="838">"Oh, well," replied the Hare, who was much amused at the idea, "let's try and see";</seg>
<seg id="838">“噢，好吧，”兔子回答，认为乌龟的这个想法太搞笑了，“我们比比看”。</seg>
<seg id="839">and it was soon agreed that the fox should set a course for them, and be the judge.</seg>
<seg id="839">他们很快便商定好了比赛的时间和地点，并且让狐狸来设定比赛过程，兼做裁判。</seg>
<seg id="840">When the time came both started off together, but the Hare was soon so far ahead that he thought he might as well have a rest:</seg>
<seg id="840">比赛一开始，兔子很快就跑到了前面，他觉着自己应该休息一下，</seg>
<seg id="841">so down he lay and fell fast asleep.</seg>
<seg id="841">于是便躺在路旁睡着了。</seg>
<seg id="842">Meanwhile the Tortoise kept plodding on, and in time reached the goal.</seg>
<seg id="842">此时，乌龟正不停地朝前奔跑，并且最后还实现了自己的目标。</seg>

<seg id="845">士兵和战马</seg>

<seg id="846">战争期间，一个士兵用充足的燕麦精心喂养他的马，希望身强体壮的马能够在需要时，驮着主人在地形艰险的战场上快速奔跑，从而免于危险。</seg>
<seg id="847">But when the war was over he employed him on all sorts of drudgery, bestowing but little attention upon him, and giving him, moreover, nothing but chaff to eat.</seg>
<seg id="847">然而，战争一结束，战马便被拉去服苦役，不仅得不到主人的关爱，而且除了糟糠之外，再也没有其它饲料了。</seg>
<seg id="848">The time came when war broke out again, and the Soldier saddled and bridled his Horse, and, having put on his heavy coat of mail, mounted him to ride off and take the field.</seg>
<seg id="848">不久，战争又爆发了，士兵备好马鞍、套上缰绳、穿上厚重的铠甲，全副武装地准备骑着马去迎敌。</seg>
<seg id="849">But the poor half-starved beast sank down under his weight, and said to his rider, "You will have to go into battle on foot this time.</seg>
<seg id="849">这时，马却毫无力气，不断摔倒，他对主人说：“这次，你可要亲自跑着赶赴战场了，</seg>
<seg id="850">Thanks to hard work and bad food, you have turned me from a Horse into an ass;</seg>
<seg id="850">都是因为繁重的劳役和廉价的饲料，让我从一匹战马变成了一头驴，</seg>
<seg id="851">and you cannot in a moment turn me back again into a Horse."</seg>
<seg id="851">你怎么还能把我当战马骑呢？”</seg>
<seg id="852">THE OXEN AND THE BUTCHERS</seg>
<seg id="852">公牛和屠夫</seg>
<seg id="853">Once upon a time the Oxen determined to be revenged upon the Butchers for the havoc they wrought in their ranks, and plotted to put them to death on a given day.</seg>
<seg id="853">有一次，公牛想报复屠夫，因为他们在屠夫那里遭受蹂躏，被分成若干等级，并且等待着某一日被屠宰。</seg>
<seg id="854">They were all gathered together discussing how best to carry out the plan, and the more violent of them were engaged in sharpening their horns for the fray, when an old Ox got up upon his feet and said, "My brothers, you have good reason, I know, to hate these Butchers, but, at any rate, they understand their trade and do what they have to do without causing unnecessary pain.</seg>
<seg id="854">他们聚集在一起商讨如何执行报复计划，其中那些比较暴躁的公牛为了这场战争已经磨好了自己的尖角，准备战斗。这时，一头年长的老公牛站起来，说：“兄弟们，我知道，大家确实有理由憎恨屠夫，但是从某种程度上讲，他们明白自己的职责，已经尽可能地减少了我们的痛苦。</seg>
<seg id="855">But if we kill them, others, who have no experience, will be set to slaughter us, and will by their bungling inflict great sufferings upon us.</seg>
<seg id="855">然而，倘若我们杀死了屠夫，就会让那些没有经验的人来宰杀我们，给我们增添更多痛苦。</seg>
<seg id="856">For you may be sure that, even though all the Butchers perish, mankind will never go without their beef."</seg>
<seg id="856">你们要知道，即便所有的屠夫都死了，但人类总是要吃牛肉的。”</seg>
<seg id="857">THE WOLF AND THE LION</seg>

<seg id="858">一次，狼从羊群中抢走一只羊，正叼着小羊往回走时，碰上了一只狮子。狮子立刻从狼口里抢走羊，大摇大摆地走了。</seg>
<seg id="859">He dared not resist, but when the Lion had gone some distance he said, "It is most unjust of you to take what's mine away from me like that."</seg>
<seg id="859">狼不敢反抗，只好乖乖等着狮子走远了，才说：“你抢走属于我的猎物，太不正当了。”</seg>
<seg id="860">The Lion laughed and called out in reply, "It was justly yours, no doubt!</seg>
<seg id="860">狮子笑着说：“那么，这东西是你正当获得的吗，</seg>

<seg id="864">The Sheep, however, was afraid that they meant to cheat her;</seg>
<seg id="864">然而，羊担心他们俩合伙欺骗自己，</seg>
<seg id="865">so she excused herself, saying, "The Wolf is in the habit of seizing what he wants and running off with it without paying, and you, too, can run much faster than I.</seg>
<seg id="865">便找了个借口，说：“狼有个坏习惯，抢完他想要的东西后便跑了，从不归还；而你则跑得比我快多了，</seg>
<seg id="866">So how shall I be able to come up with either of you when the debt falls due?"</seg>

<seg id="869">三头公牛住在一个草场里，窥探已久的一只狮子想要吃掉他们，可是只要公牛团结一致，狮子就无法得逞。</seg>
<seg id="870">So he began by false whispers and malicious hints to foment jealousies and distrust among them.</seg>
<seg id="870">于是，狮子便在公牛之中煽风点火，不怀好意地挑拨离间，令他们产生冲突和愤恨。</seg>
<seg id="871">This stratagem succeeded so well that ere long the Bulls grew cold and unfriendly, and finally avoided each other and fed each one by himself apart.</seg>
<seg id="871">狮子的计谋终于得逞了，三头公牛不如以前那么友好了，相互之间很冷淡，随后互不相见，各自到草场里吃草。</seg>

<seg id="876">马一感受到背上的重量，就狂奔起来，什么也挡不住他。</seg>

<seg id="881">葡萄藤对母山羊说：“我做过什么对不起你的事吗？</seg>
<seg id="882">Isn't there grass enough for you to feed on?</seg>
<seg id="882">难道地上没有青草吃了？</seg>

<seg id="892">一条老猎狗已经尽心尽力为主人服务了很多年，现在已经衰老了，也失去了年轻力壮时的力气和速度。</seg>

<seg id="894">老猎狗咬住了野猪的耳朵，可是由于他的牙齿已经脱落，根本无法牢牢地咬住野猪，于是，野猪侥幸逃跑了。</seg>

<seg id="895">主人严厉地痛骂了他一顿，老猎狗打断主人的斥骂，说：“主人呀，我倒是也想像以前一样强壮，但我的身体已经衰老无力了。</seg>
<seg id="896">You ought to honour me for what I have been instead of abusing me for what I am."</seg>

<seg id="898">一个富翁对外宣称要在剧场搞一次公开表演，并且还说，要重重奖励那些表演新戏法的人。</seg>

<seg id="899">这个公告吸引了一群魔术师、杂耍艺人和杂技演员，其中，一个广受欢迎的小丑说他要在台上表演一个全新的把戏。</seg>
<seg id="900">When the day of the performance came, the theatre was filled from top to bottom some time before the entertainment began.</seg>
<seg id="900">到了公开表演的那一天，还没开场，整个剧场就已被围得水泄不通。</seg>
<seg id="901">Several performers exhibited their tricks, and then the popular favourite came on empty-handed and alone.</seg>
<seg id="901">几个演员表演了他们的特技之后，小丑接着就两手空空地独自一人出现在舞台上。</seg>
<seg id="902">At once there was a hush of expectation:</seg>
<seg id="902">观众因为太期待看他的表演，全场立刻鸦雀无声。</seg>
<seg id="903">and he, letting his head fall upon his breast, imitated the squeak of a pig to such perfection that the audience insisted on his producing the animal, which, they said, he must have somewhere concealed about his person.</seg>
<seg id="903">而小丑突然把头俯到胸前，学小猪叫，他叫的声音逼真得使人惊叹，以至于大家都说，他一定是把猪藏在什么地方了。</seg>
<seg id="904">He, however, convinced them that there was no pig there, and then the applause was deafening.</seg>
<seg id="904">然而，他却说服观众，并没有藏起猪来，接着，全场掌声雷鸣。</seg>
<seg id="905">Among the spectators was a Countryman, who disparaged the Clown's performance and announced that he would give a much superior exhibition of the same trick on the following day.</seg>
<seg id="905">场下有一位观众是个乡下人，看完小丑的表演后，他就宣称自己明天也要表演同样的把戏，一定会比小丑的更好。</seg>
<seg id="906">Again the theatre was filled to overflowing, and again the Clown gave his imitation amidst the cheers of the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="906">第二天，剧场里又挤满了人，小丑照样以他的模仿秀赢得了观众的欢呼和喜爱。</seg>
<seg id="907">The Countryman, meanwhile, before going on the stage, had secreted a young porker under his smock;</seg>
<seg id="907">同时站在舞台上的乡下人，早已在上台前，将一只小猪藏到了衣服里，</seg>
<seg id="908">and when the spectators derisively bade him do better if he could, he gave it a pinch in the ear and made it squeal loudly.</seg>
<seg id="908">就在观众嘲弄他是否能表演得更精彩时，他揪了一下小猪的耳朵，让他大声叫起来。</seg>
<seg id="909">But they all with one voice shouted out that the Clown's imitation was much more true to life.</seg>
<seg id="909">然而，观众们都大喊小丑的叫声更逼真。</seg>
<seg id="910">Thereupon he produced the pig from under his smock and said sarcastically, "There, that shows what sort of judges you are!"</seg>
<seg id="910">于是，乡下人便从衣服里拿出小猪来，讽刺地说：“请看这里，你们到底是什么样的裁判呀！”</seg>

<seg id="913">One day, before the young were fully fledged, the Farmer came to look at the crop, and, finding it yellowing fast, he said, "I must send round word to my neighbours to come and help me reap this field."</seg>
<seg id="913">虽然小百灵鸟们的羽翼还未完全丰满，但有一天，农夫来田里看庄稼，发现麦子已经变黄了，便说：“我得去告诉邻居们，帮我到田里来收割庄稼。”</seg>
<seg id="914">One of the young Larks overheard him, and was very much frightened, and asked her mother whether they hadn't better move house at once.</seg>
<seg id="914">一只小百灵鸟听到了这番话，心里非常害怕，便赶忙问妈妈是否应该立刻搬家。</seg>

<seg id="916">"a man who looks to his friends for help will take his time about a thing."</seg>
<seg id="916">“孩子，请朋友来帮忙是需要时间的。”</seg>
<seg id="917">In a few days the Farmer came by again, and saw that the grain was overripe and falling out of the ears upon the ground.</seg>

<seg id="919">"This very day I'll hire the men and set them to work at once."</seg>
<seg id="919">我今天就得雇人，立刻开始收割。”</seg>
<seg id="920">The Lark heard him and said to her young, "Come, my children, we must be off:</seg>
<seg id="920">百灵鸟听到这话后，便对小鸟们说：“我的孩子们，现在我们必须要搬家了，</seg>
<seg id="921">he talks no more of his friends now, but is going to take things in hand himself."</seg>

<seg id="929">等到洞里空无一只羊之后，驴跑出洞来，说：“怎么样，我把他们都吓出来了，干得不错吧？”</seg>
<seg id="930">"I should think you did," said the Lion: "why, if I hadn't known you were an Ass, I should have turned and run myself."</seg>

<seg id="934">算命的人大吃一惊，立刻气得跳了起来，唉声叹气地赶回家中。</seg>

<seg id="944">在旁观察的狐狸见后，心想可以和狮子开个玩笑，便开口说道：“我可是第一次看见狮子惧怕老鼠。”</seg>

<seg id="985">A Tunny-fish was chased by a Dolphin and splashed through the water at a great rate, but the Dolphin gradually gained upon him, and was just about to seize him when the force of his flight carried the Tunny on to a sandbank.</seg>
<seg id="985">一条金枪鱼在水中急速穿行，而追赶他的海豚一直在后面穷追不舍，眼看着就要被海豚捉住了，金枪鱼猛然一跳，不料用劲太猛，让自己在岸边搁浅了。</seg>
<seg id="986">In the heat of the chase the Dolphin followed him, and there they both lay out of the water, gasping for dear life.</seg>
<seg id="986">紧追不舍的海豚因为惯性也跟着金枪鱼一跳，同样搁浅在岸边。</seg>
<seg id="987">When the Tunny saw that his enemy was doomed like himself, he said, "I don't mind having to die now:</seg>
<seg id="987">这时，金枪鱼看到敌人也像自己一样奄奄一息，便说：“现在，死对我来说已经无所谓了，</seg>

<seg id="991">一个木匠挺身而出，主张用木头作为防御材料，既随手可得又操作简单；</seg>
<seg id="992">A Stone-mason objected to wood on the ground that it was so inflammable, and recommended stones instead.</seg>
<seg id="992">一个石匠毅然反对，他说木头容易被点燃，太不安全了，而他则提议用石头。</seg>

<seg id="996">一头公牛被老鼠咬了鼻子，到处追赶老鼠。</seg>
<seg id="997">but the Mouse was too quick for him and slipped into a hole in a wall.</seg>
<seg id="997">但是，老鼠可比公牛跑得快多了，一下就溜进了墙边的洞里。</seg>
<seg id="998">The Bull charged furiously into the wall again and again until he was tired out, and sank down on the ground exhausted with his efforts.</seg>
<seg id="998">气得公牛一次又一次地撞墙，最后累得筋疲力尽，一下就瘫在了地上。</seg>
<seg id="999">When all was quiet, the Mouse darted out and bit him again.</seg>
<seg id="999">这时，小老鼠一听没了动静，又跑出来再咬公牛。</seg>
<seg id="1000">Beside himself with rage he started to his feet, but by that time the Mouse was back in his hole again, and he could do nothing but bellow and fume in helpless anger.</seg>
<seg id="1000">公牛狂怒，又开始用脚踢墙，而此时小老鼠早已跑回到洞里去了。除了大吼和无用的生闷气之外，公牛一筹莫展。</seg>
<seg id="1001">Presently he heard a shrill little voice say from inside the wall, "You big fellows don't always have it your own way, you see: sometimes we little ones come off best."</seg>
<seg id="1001">不久，他听到一个微弱的声音从墙壁里传出来：“你这个大家伙也不能总逞强吧，你看，有时我们这样的小不点也会占上风的。”</seg>

<seg id="1006">A rustic who had seen the race met the Hound as he was returning, and taunted him with his defeat.</seg>
<seg id="1006">一个农民关注了整个过程，在路上遇见往回走的猎狗时，讥笑它是个失败者。</seg>
<seg id="1007">"The little one was too much for you," said he.</seg>
<seg id="1007">“那个小家伙可比你强多了，”农民说。</seg>
<seg id="1008">"Ah, well," said the Hound, "don't forget it's one thing to be running for your dinner, but quite another to be running for your life."</seg>
<seg id="1008">“噢，是吗？”猎狗说，“不要忘了，一个是仅为一顿饭在跑，而另一个则是为了一条命在跑。”</seg>
<seg id="1009">THE TOWN MOUSE AND THE COUNTRY MOUSE</seg>
<seg id="1009">城市鼠和乡下鼠</seg>
<seg id="1010">A Town Mouse and a Country Mouse were acquaintances, and the Country Mouse one day invited his friend to come and see him at his home in the fields.</seg>
<seg id="1010">一只住在城里的老鼠和一只住在乡下的老鼠是好朋友。有一天，乡下鼠邀请城市老鼠到他的家里来玩，看看他那田地里的家。</seg>
<seg id="1011">The Town Mouse came, and they sat down to a dinner of barleycorns and roots, the latter of which had a distinctly earthy flavour.</seg>
<seg id="1011">城里鼠如约而至，他们坐下来分享了以大麦粒和树根为主的晚餐，那些树根还带着一种独特的泥土气息。</seg>
<seg id="1012">The fare was not much to the taste of the guest, and presently he broke out with "My poor dear friend, you live here no better than the ants.</seg>
<seg id="1012">这些食物显然不太对客人的胃口，最后，客人忍不住脱口而出：“可怜的朋友，你在这里生活，比蚂蚁好不到哪里去。</seg>
<seg id="1013">Now, you should just see how I fare!</seg>
<seg id="1013">你真应该去看看我都吃些什么！</seg>
<seg id="1014">My larder is a regular horn of plenty.</seg>
<seg id="1014">我的储藏室里可都是好东西，</seg>
<seg id="1015">You must come and stay with me, and I promise you you shall live on the fat of the land."</seg>
<seg id="1015">你一定得来和我一起生活，我保证你一定会过上锦衣玉食的日子！”</seg>
<seg id="1016">So when he returned to town he took the Country Mouse with him, and showed him into a larder containing flour and oatmeal and figs and honey and dates.</seg>
<seg id="1016">于是，城里鼠带着乡下鼠回到了城里，还让他欣赏了装满面粉、燕麦、无花果、蜂蜜和大枣的储藏室。</seg>
<seg id="1017">The Country Mouse had never seen anything like it, and sat down to enjoy the luxuries his friend provided:</seg>
<seg id="1017">乡下鼠从未见过这么多的美食，坐下来好好欣赏着朋友提供的这些佳肴，</seg>
<seg id="1018">but before they had well begun, the door of the larder opened and some one came in.</seg>
<seg id="1018">就在他们正要开始吃的时候，储藏室的门被打开了，有人走了进来。</seg>
<seg id="1019">The two Mice scampered off and hid themselves in a narrow and exceedingly uncomfortable hole.</seg>
<seg id="1019">两只老鼠立刻惊慌而逃，赶紧钻进了一个窄小的鼠洞。</seg>
<seg id="1020">Presently, when all was quiet, they ventured out again;</seg>
<seg id="1020">不久，储藏室里又恢复了平静，他们接着跑出来，</seg>
<seg id="1021">but some one else came in, and off they scuttled again.</seg>
<seg id="1021">不过，接着又有人进屋来拿东西。</seg>
<seg id="1022">This was too much for the visitor.</seg>
<seg id="1022">乡下来的客人可不习惯这种躲躲藏藏的生活方式。</seg>
<seg id="1023">"Good-bye," said he, "I'm off.</seg>
<seg id="1023">“再见了，朋友！”他说，“我要走了。</seg>
<seg id="1024">You live in the lap of luxury, I can see, but you are surrounded by dangers;</seg>
<seg id="1024">你的确是过着锦衣玉食的日子，我已经看到了，但是你却时刻处在危险之中，</seg>
<seg id="1025">whereas at home I can enjoy my simple dinner of roots and corn in peace."</seg>
<seg id="1025">而我还是回家去平平安安地享受那简单的树根和大麦吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1026">THE LION AND THE BULL</seg>
<seg id="1026">狮子和公牛</seg>
<seg id="1027">A Lion saw a fine fat Bull pasturing among a herd of cattle and cast about for some means of getting him into his clutches;</seg>
<seg id="1027">狮子看见牛群中有一头体态肥硕的公牛在吃草，便思忖着用什么方法能让公牛受骗上当。</seg>
<seg id="1028">so he sent him word that he was sacrificing a sheep, and asked if he would do him the honour of dining with him.</seg>
<seg id="1028">于是，狮子对公牛说自己杀了一只羊，并问他是否愿意赏光，和自己共同分享这只羊。</seg>
<seg id="1029">The Bull accepted the invitation, but, on arriving at the Lion's den, he saw a great array of saucepans and spits, but no sign of a sheep; so he turned on his heel and walked quietly away.</seg>
<seg id="1029">公牛接受了邀请，但是当公牛向着狮子的巢穴走时，只看到了炖锅和水，根本没看见羊的痕迹。于是，他一声不吭地转身走了。</seg>
<seg id="1030">The Lion called after him in an injured tone to ask the reason, and the Bull turned round and said, "I have reason enough.</seg>
<seg id="1030">狮子在他身后大喊，带着受伤的语气询问原因，而公牛则转身说：“我的理由很充分，</seg>
<seg id="1031">When I saw all your preparations it struck me at once that the victim was to be a Bull and not a sheep."</seg>
<seg id="1031">一看到你准备的那些东西，我就惊呆了，那个受害者可能不是一只羊，而是一头公牛。”</seg>
<seg id="1032">The net is spread in vain in sight of the bird.</seg>

<seg id="1034">A Wolf charged a Fox with theft, which he denied, and the case was brought before an Ape to be tried.</seg>
<seg id="1034">一只狼指责狐狸偷了他的东西，而狐狸却根本不承认，于是，他们请猿猴来裁决。</seg>
<seg id="1035">When he had heard the evidence on both sides, the Ape gave judgment as follows: "I do not think," he said, "that you, O Wolf, ever lost what you claim;</seg>
<seg id="1035">他们双方各自陈述了理由后，猿猴给出了如下裁决：“狼，我认为你没有丢失什么东西；</seg>
<seg id="1036">but all the same I believe that you, Fox, are guilty of the theft, in spite of all your denials."</seg>
<seg id="1036">但同时我也相信，狐狸即使偷过东西，也死不承认。”</seg>

<seg id="1041">while the victor flew up on to the roof of the stables and crowed lustily.</seg>

<seg id="1047">可是，寒鸦很不愿意与人一起生活。</seg>
<seg id="1048">so, after a while, when he seemed to have become fairly tame and they didn't watch him so closely, he slipped away and flew back to his old haunts.</seg>
<seg id="1048">过了一段时间后，当他看上去似乎已经被驯服了时，人们便不再密切监视他了。于是，寒鸦趁机逃出去，飞回了自己的老巢。</seg>
<seg id="1049">Unfortunately, the string was still on his leg, and before long it got entangled in the branches of a tree and the Jackdaw couldn't get free, try as he would.</seg>
<seg id="1049">不幸的是，他的腿上依然还绑着那根绳子，很快便被树枝缠住再也飞不起来了。</seg>

<seg id="1053">于是，他设置了一个捕获狐狸的圈套。</seg>
<seg id="1054">and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go.</seg>
<seg id="1054">为了能狠狠地报复一下狐狸，农夫在狐狸的尾巴上绑了一捆麻绳，然后点上火，让狐狸在院子里上蹿下跳。</seg>
<seg id="1055">As ill-luck would have it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting.</seg>

<seg id="1060">仁慈的爱神维纳斯同意了她的请求，立即将她变成了一个美丽的少女。青年男子对她一见钟情，很快两人就结婚了。</seg>

<seg id="1066">一只乌鸦非常妒忌白天鹅那美丽的羽翼，以为那一身漂亮的白色羽毛是由于经常在水中游泳和洗浴而得来的。</seg>
<seg id="1067">So he left the neighbourhood of the altars, where he got his living by picking up bits of the meat offered in sacrifice, and went and lived among the pools and streams.</seg>
<seg id="1067">于是，乌鸦便离开了靠着肉类祭祀品而赖以谋生的祭坛，前往池塘和溪流中居住。</seg>
<seg id="1068">But though he bathed and washed his feathers many times a day, he didn't make them any whiter, and at last died of hunger into the bargain.</seg>

<seg id="1105">战马垂头丧气地哀叹着自己的命运，有一天，他对磨坊主说：“唉，我曾经可是一匹光彩照人的战马，不仅披着华丽的战袍，而且还有专门的马倌照顾我。</seg>
<seg id="1106">How different is my present condition!</seg>
<seg id="1106">现如今，我这是什么下场呀！</seg>
<seg id="1107">I wish I had never given up the battlefield for the mill."</seg>
<seg id="1107">真希望我当初没有离开战场，为什么要到这个磨坊来呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1108">The Miller replied with asperity, "It's no use your regretting the past.</seg>
<seg id="1108">磨坊主粗暴地回答说：“不必追悔过去，</seg>
<seg id="1109">Fortune has many ups and downs: you must just take them as they come."</seg>
<seg id="1109">命运总会有所起伏，随缘而安就好了。”</seg>
<seg id="1110">THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE OWL</seg>
<seg id="1110">蚂蚱和猫头鹰</seg>
<seg id="1111">An Owl, who lived in a hollow tree, was in the habit of feeding by night and sleeping by day;</seg>
<seg id="1111">栖息在一棵枯树上的猫头鹰，习惯于晚上觅食、白天睡觉。</seg>
<seg id="1112">but her slumbers were greatly disturbed by the chirping of a Grasshopper, who had taken up his abode in the branches.</seg>
<seg id="1112">可是，她白天却也睡不好，一只早已在树丛间做窝的蚂蚱总发出啁啾声，吵得她无法入睡。</seg>
<seg id="1113">She begged him repeatedly to have some consideration for her comfort, but the Grasshopper, if anything, only chirped the louder.</seg>
<seg id="1113">猫头鹰不断地请求蚂蚱考虑一下她的情况，可蚂蚱却仍然大声叫个不停。</seg>
<seg id="1114">At last the Owl could stand it no longer, but determined to rid herself of the pest by means of a trick.</seg>
<seg id="1114">最后，猫头鹰再也受不了了，决定设计除掉蚂蚱。</seg>
<seg id="1115">Addressing herself to the Grasshopper, she said in her pleasantest manner, "As I cannot sleep for your song, which, believe me, is as sweet as the notes of Apollo's lyre, I have a mind to taste some nectar, which Minerva gave me the other day.</seg>
<seg id="1115">于是，猫头鹰装出一副高兴样，对蚂蚱说：“尽管我被你的歌声惊扰，睡不着觉，但是请相信我，你的歌声如同阿波罗神的七弦琴一样动听。我正想喝一点美味琼浆，这可是密涅瓦（智慧女神，即希腊神话中的雅典娜）送给我的。</seg>
<seg id="1116">Won't you come in and join me?"</seg>
<seg id="1116">你要不要上来和我一起享用呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1117">The Grasshopper was flattered by the praise of his song, and his mouth, too, watered at the mention of the delicious drink, so he said he would be delighted.</seg>
<seg id="1117">蚂蚱正得意于猫头鹰对自己歌声的奉承，一听到有琼浆玉液，嘴巴里就开始流口水了，所以，他很高兴地接受了邀请。</seg>
<seg id="1118">No sooner had he got inside the hollow where the Owl was sitting than she pounced upon him and ate him up.</seg>
<seg id="1118">待他刚一飞上去，猫头鹰就从树洞中冲出来，扑过去抓住蚂蚱，吃掉了他。</seg>
<seg id="1119">THE GRASSHOPPER AND THE ANTS</seg>
<seg id="1119">蚂蚱和蚂蚁</seg>
<seg id="1120">One fine day in winter some Ants were busy drying their store of corn, which had got rather damp during a long spell of rain.</seg>
<seg id="1120">冬天一个温暖如春的日子里，蚂蚁们正忙着晒干自己存储的粮食。由于下了很长时间的雨，粮食已经非常潮湿了。</seg>
<seg id="1121">Presently up came a Grasshopper and begged them to spare her a few grains,</seg>
<seg id="1121">这时，来了一只蚂蚱，向他们乞讨一点粮食。</seg>
<seg id="1122">"For," she said, "I'm simply starving."</seg>
<seg id="1122">“因为，”蚂蚱说，“我实在是饿坏了。”</seg>
<seg id="1123">The Ants stopped work for a moment, though this was against their principles.</seg>
<seg id="1123">尽管有点违背原则，但蚂蚁们还是停下了手头的工作。</seg>
<seg id="1124">"May we ask," said they, "what you were doing with yourself all last summer?</seg>
<seg id="1124">“我们能问你一下吗？”他们说，“整个夏天你都在做些什么呢？</seg>
<seg id="1125">Why didn't you collect a store of food for the winter?"</seg>
<seg id="1125">为什么不为冬天储存一些粮食呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1126">"The fact is," replied the Grasshopper, "I was so busy singing that I hadn't the time."</seg>
<seg id="1126">“实际上，”蚂蚱回答道，“我一直在忙着唱歌，根本没有时间存储粮食。”</seg>
<seg id="1127">"If you spent the summer singing," replied the Ants, "you can't do better than spend the winter dancing."</seg>
<seg id="1127">“如果你整个夏天都在唱歌，”蚂蚁们回答道，“那么，你最好在冬天就忙着跳舞吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1128">And they chuckled and went on with their work.</seg>
<seg id="1128">他们哈哈大笑起来，继续忙于各自的工作。</seg>
<seg id="1129">THE FARMER AND THE VIPER</seg>
<seg id="1129">农夫与蛇</seg>
<seg id="1130">One winter a Farmer found a Viper frozen and numb with cold, and out of pity picked it up and placed it in his bosom.</seg>
<seg id="1130">在一个冬日，农夫发现了一条冻僵了的蛇，出于同情心，农夫便把蛇放在自己怀里。</seg>
<seg id="1131">The Viper was no sooner revived by the warmth than it turned upon its benefactor and inflicted a fatal bite upon him;</seg>
<seg id="1131">蛇感觉到一点温暖苏醒过来，立刻就冲着恩人咬了一大口，使他受到了致命的伤害。</seg>
<seg id="1132">and as the poor man lay dying, he cried, "I have only got what I deserved, for taking compassion on so villainous a creature."</seg>
<seg id="1132">这个可怜的农夫在临死前说：“这是我应得的报应，竟然会怜悯一个罪大恶极的生灵。”</seg>
<seg id="1133">Kindness is thrown away upon the evil.</seg>
<seg id="1133">在邪恶面前，仁慈应被抛开。</seg>
<seg id="1134">THE TWO FROGS</seg>
<seg id="1134">两只青蛙</seg>
<seg id="1135">Two Frogs were neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1135">两只青蛙比邻而居。</seg>
<seg id="1136">One lived in a marsh, where there was plenty of water, which frogs love:</seg>
<seg id="1136">一只住在青蛙们钟爱的湿地里，</seg>
<seg id="1137">the other in a lane some distance away, where all the water to be had was that which lay in the ruts after rain.</seg>
<seg id="1137">另一只却住在稍微远一点的一条小路上，只有下过雨后，那里才能形成一个小水洼。</seg>
<seg id="1138">The Marsh Frog warned his friend and pressed him to come and live with him in the marsh, for he would find his quarters there far more comfortable and--what was still more important--more safe.</seg>
<seg id="1138">住在湿地里的青蛙提醒并督促自己的朋友，尽快搬到湿地这边来住，因为这里十分舒适，更重要的是，这里更安全。</seg>
<seg id="1139">But the other refused, saying that he could not bring himself to move from a place to which he had become accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="1139">可是，另一只青蛙却拒绝了，说自己不想离开已经习惯了的地方。</seg>
<seg id="1140">A few days afterwards a heavy waggon came down the lane, and he was crushed to death under the wheels.</seg>
<seg id="1140">结果，没过几天，一辆载着重物的货车经过小路，而这只青蛙不幸被车轮碾死了。</seg>
<seg id="1141">THE COBBLER TURNED DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1141">修鞋匠行医</seg>
<seg id="1142">A very unskilful Cobbler, finding himself unable to make a living at his trade, gave up mending boots and took to doctoring instead.</seg>
<seg id="1142">一个手艺不怎么样的鞋匠发现自己无法靠修鞋来维持生计，便放弃了补鞋的活，改行做起了医生。</seg>
<seg id="1143">He gave out that he had the secret of a universal antidote against all poisons, and acquired no small reputation, thanks to his talent for puffing himself.</seg>
<seg id="1143">他对外宣称自己有一个可祛百毒的解药秘方，因为出色的吹牛本领，他骗取了人们的信任，赢得了好名声。</seg>
<seg id="1144">One day, however, he fell very ill;</seg>
<seg id="1144">然而，有一天，他自己得了重病。</seg>
<seg id="1145">and the King of the country bethought him that he would test the value of his remedy.</seg>
<seg id="1145">国王想借此试验一下他的药效，</seg>
<seg id="1146">Calling, therefore, for a cup, he poured out a dose of the antidote, and, under pretence of mixing poison with it, added a little water, and commanded him to drink it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">因此便叫人拿来一个杯子，倒了一点他的解药，然后加了些水，谎称这是毒药，随后又命令他喝下去。</seg>
<seg id="1147">Terrified by the fear of being poisoned, the Cobbler confessed that he knew nothing about medicine, and that his antidote was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="1147">补鞋匠担心会中毒，便承认自己并不懂什么医药知识，而那个解药也一无是处。</seg>
<seg id="1148">Then the King summoned his subjects and addressed them as follows: "What folly could be greater than yours?</seg>
<seg id="1148">国王便召集起所有臣民，对他们说：“你们简直都愚笨至极，</seg>
<seg id="1149">Here is this Cobbler to whom no one will send his boots to be mended, and yet you have not hesitated to entrust him with your lives!"</seg>
<seg id="1149">这就是那个没人愿意让他给补靴子的修鞋匠，而你们竟然毫不犹豫地将自己的性命托付给他！”</seg>
<seg id="1150">THE ASS, THE COCK, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1150">驴、公鸡和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1151">An Ass and a Cock were in a cattle-pen together.</seg>
<seg id="1151">一头驴和一只公鸡在牛圈里一起生活。</seg>
<seg id="1152">Presently a Lion, who had been starving for days, came along and was just about to fall upon the Ass and make a meal of him when the Cock, rising to his full height and flapping his wings vigorously, uttered a tremendous crow.</seg>
<seg id="1152">不久，一只饿了好几天的狮子走过来，想要逮一头驴当饭吃。这时，公鸡站起来，扑腾着翅膀大叫了起来。</seg>
<seg id="1153">Now, if there is one thing that frightens a Lion, it is the crowing of a Cock:</seg>
<seg id="1153">假如真有什么东西能使狮子害怕的话，那一定是公鸡扑腾着翅膀的大叫声。</seg>
<seg id="1154">and this one had no sooner heard the noise than he fled.</seg>
<seg id="1154">[无]</seg>
<seg id="1155">The Ass was mightily elated at this, and thought that, if the Lion couldn't face a Cock, he would be still less likely to stand up to an Ass:</seg>
<seg id="1155">而驴却因此而洋洋自得，心想如果狮子都不敢面对一只小公鸡，那就更不敢面对一头驴了。</seg>
<seg id="1156">so he ran out and pursued him.</seg>
<seg id="1156">于是，他立即跑出去追赶狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1157">But when the two had got well out of sight and hearing of the Cock, the Lion suddenly turned upon the Ass and ate him up.</seg>
<seg id="1157">然而，等他们跑远了，听不到公鸡的叫声时，狮子猛然转过身来，把驴吃掉了。</seg>
<seg id="1158">False confidence often leads to disaster.</seg>
<seg id="1158">盲目的自信通常会导致失败。</seg>
<seg id="1159">THE BELLY AND THE MEMBERS</seg>
<seg id="1159">胃和体内的各器官</seg>
<seg id="1160">The Members of the Body once rebelled against the Belly.</seg>
<seg id="1160">有一次，人体内的各个器官集体抗议胃。</seg>
<seg id="1161">"You," they said to the Belly, "live in luxury and sloth, and never do a stroke of work;</seg>
<seg id="1161">他们说：“你过着享受的日子，又很懒惰，从来没有干过什么活，</seg>
<seg id="1162">while we not only have to do all the hard work there is to be done, but are actually your slaves and have to minister to all your wants.</seg>
<seg id="1162">而我们不仅要承担繁重的必要工作，还得甘当你的奴隶，为满足你的各种欲望而服务。</seg>
<seg id="1163">Now, we will do so no longer, and you can shift for yourself for the future."</seg>
<seg id="1163">从现在起，我们什么也不做了，你自力更生吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1164">They were as good as their word, and left the Belly to starve.</seg>
<seg id="1164">他们的确说到做到了，胃只得一直挨饿。</seg>
<seg id="1165">The result was just what might have been expected: the whole Body soon began to fail, and the Members and all shared in the general collapse.</seg>
<seg id="1165">而结果可能是他们早已预料到的——整个身体很快就虚弱下来，体内的各个器官也跟着一起衰弱下来。</seg>
<seg id="1166">And then they saw too late how foolish they had been.</seg>
<seg id="1166">他们这才悔恨自己的愚蠢，可为时已晚了。</seg>
<seg id="1167">THE BALD MAN AND THE FLY</seg>
<seg id="1167">秃子和苍蝇</seg>
<seg id="1168">A Fly settled on the head of a Bald Man and bit him.</seg>
<seg id="1168">一只苍蝇落在一个秃顶的男人头上，还咬了他一口。</seg>
<seg id="1169">In his eagerness to kill it, he hit himself a smart slap.</seg>
<seg id="1169">带着想杀死它的迫切心情，男人猛打了自己一下。</seg>
<seg id="1170">But the Fly escaped, and said to him in derision, "You tried to kill me for just one little bite;</seg>
<seg id="1170">但是，苍蝇却逃脱了，并且嘲笑他说：“就因为我小小地咬了你一口，你就想杀死我。</seg>
<seg id="1171">what will you do to yourself now, for the heavy smack you have just given yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="1171">看看你现在都干了些什么，反倒狠狠地打了自己。”</seg>
<seg id="1172">"Oh, for that blow I bear no grudge," he replied, "for I never intended myself any harm;</seg>
<seg id="1172">“噢，我打自己倒不怨恨，”那个人答道，“因为我从来没有想过伤害自己，</seg>
<seg id="1173">but as for you, you contemptible insect, who live by sucking human blood, I'd have borne a good deal more than that for the satisfaction of dashing the life out of you!"</seg>
<seg id="1173">而你却是一个以吸吮人类鲜血为生的卑鄙家伙，要了你的命，才会让我舒服点！”</seg>
<seg id="1174">THE ASS AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1174">驴和狼</seg>
<seg id="1175">An Ass was feeding in a meadow, and, catching sight of his enemy the Wolf in the distance, pretended to be very lame and hobbled painfully along.</seg>
<seg id="1175">一头驴正在牧场里吃草，看见远处有一只狼向他跑来，便装出瘸腿的样子，独自徐徐前行。</seg>
<seg id="1176">When the Wolf came up, he asked the Ass how he came to be so lame, and the Ass replied that in going through a hedge he had trodden on a thorn, and he begged the Wolf to pull it out with his teeth,</seg>
<seg id="1176">狼走过来，问驴为何一瘸一拐，驴则回答说自己在越过篱笆时脚掌被刺扎伤，并且还请求狼用牙齿帮他拔掉刺。</seg>
<seg id="1177">"In case," he said, "when you eat me, it should stick in your throat and hurt you very much."</seg>
<seg id="1177">“只是以防万一，”驴说，“你吃我的时候，这根刺有可能会卡在你的喉咙里，会弄疼你的。”</seg>
<seg id="1178">The Wolf said he would, and told the Ass to lift up his foot, and gave his whole mind to getting out the thorn.</seg>
<seg id="1178">狼信以为真，便让驴抬起腿来，好让他全力拨出那根刺。</seg>
<seg id="1179">But the Ass suddenly let out with his heels and fetched the Wolf a fearful kick in the mouth, breaking his teeth;</seg>
<seg id="1179">然而，驴突然抬腿用脚后跟对准狼的嘴使劲一蹬，踢碎了狼的牙齿，接着便全速跑开了。</seg>
<seg id="1180">and then he galloped off at full speed.</seg>
<seg id="1180">[无]</seg>
<seg id="1181">As soon as he could speak the Wolf growled to himself, "It serves me right:</seg>
<seg id="1181">刚能开口讲话，狼就咆哮道：“我真活该！</seg>
<seg id="1182">my father taught me to kill, and I ought to have stuck to that trade instead of attempting to cure."</seg>
<seg id="1182">爸爸教我要杀死它，我真应该乖乖听话，怎么还想去救他呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1183">THE MONKEY AND THE CAMEL</seg>
<seg id="1183">猴子和骆驼</seg>
<seg id="1184">At a gathering of all the beasts the Monkey gave an exhibition of dancing and entertained the company vastly.</seg>
<seg id="1184">在一次百兽集会上，猴子兴奋地载歌载舞，大获赞赏。</seg>
<seg id="1185">There was great applause at the finish, which excited the envy of the Camel and made him desire to win the favour of the assembly by the same means.</seg>
<seg id="1185">待表演完后，百兽个个为之喝彩。骆驼十分嫉妒猴子，就想用同样的方式也赢得大家的喝彩。</seg>
<seg id="1186">So he got up from his place and began dancing, but he cut such a ridiculous figure as he plunged about, and made such a grotesque exhibition of his ungainly person, that the beasts all fell upon him with ridicule and drove him away.</seg>
<seg id="1186">于是，他站了起来，开始显示自己的舞技，他那怪异的姿态真是洋相百出。结果，因为这不雅的表演，百兽们哄他下台，并把他赶跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1187">THE SICK MAN AND THE DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1187">病人和医生</seg>
<seg id="1188">A Sick Man received a visit from his Doctor, who asked him how he was.</seg>
<seg id="1188">有个人生了病，请医生来看病，医生问他感觉如何。</seg>
<seg id="1189">"Fairly well, Doctor," said he, "but I find I sweat a great deal."</seg>
<seg id="1189">“还好，医生，”他说，“就是发现有点出汗过多。”</seg>
<seg id="1190">"Ah," said the Doctor, "that's a good sign."</seg>
<seg id="1190">医生说：“这是好事。”</seg>
<seg id="1191">On his next visit he asked the same question, and his patient replied, "I'm much as usual, but I've taken to having shivering fits, which leave me cold all over."</seg>
<seg id="1191">第二次来看病人时，医生又问他同样的问题，他回答说：“和以前差不多，就是有点发抖，总感觉冷。”</seg>
<seg id="1192">"Ah," said the Doctor, "that's a good sign too."</seg>
<seg id="1192">医生又说：“这也是好现象。”</seg>
<seg id="1193">When he came the third time and inquired as before about his patient's health, the Sick Man said that he felt very feverish.</seg>
<seg id="1193">医生第三次来看他，又询问他的健康状况时，病人说感觉自己在发烧。</seg>
<seg id="1194">"A very good sign," said the Doctor;</seg>
<seg id="1194">“非常好的现象，”医生说，</seg>
<seg id="1195">"you are doing very nicely indeed."</seg>
<seg id="1195">“其实，你的身体很正常。”</seg>
<seg id="1196">Afterwards a friend came to see the invalid, and on asking him how he did, received this reply: "My dear friend, I'm dying of good signs."</seg>
<seg id="1196">随后，病人的一个朋友来看他，并且问他感觉如何，他说：“我就要因为这些好现象而丧命了。”</seg>
<seg id="1197">THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PLANE-TREE</seg>
<seg id="1197">旅人和法国梧桐树</seg>
<seg id="1198">Two Travellers were walking along a bare and dusty road in the heat of a summer's day.</seg>
<seg id="1198">夏季里的一天，正值中午酷热难耐时，两个行人走在空旷且尘土飞扬的马路上。</seg>
<seg id="1199">Coming presently to a Plane-tree, they joyfully turned aside to shelter from the burning rays of the sun in the deep shade of its spreading branches.</seg>
<seg id="1199">不久，他们来到一棵梧桐树下，躺在茂密树叶遮蔽的阴凉地里休息，从而躲避太阳的毒晒。</seg>
<seg id="1200">As they rested, looking up into the tree, one of them remarked to his companion, "What a useless tree the Plane is!</seg>
<seg id="1200">在休息时，他们抬头看着枝叶四散的大树，其中一人对同伴说：“这棵树没什么用处呀！</seg>
<seg id="1201">It bears no fruit and is of no service to man at all."</seg>
<seg id="1201">它没有结果，对人类没有什么好处。”</seg>
<seg id="1202">The Plane-tree interrupted him with indignation.</seg>
<seg id="1202">梧桐树生气地打断了他们的谈话。</seg>
<seg id="1203">"You ungrateful creature!" it cried:</seg>
<seg id="1203">“你们这些不知好歹的家伙！”它吼道，</seg>
<seg id="1204">"you come and take shelter under me from the scorching sun, and then, in the very act of enjoying the cool shade of my foliage, you abuse me and call me good for nothing!"</seg>
<seg id="1204">“你们走过来在这里寻找遮挡太阳的避难所，一边享受着我的树叶带来的阴凉，一边还骂我，说我是无用之材！”</seg>
<seg id="1205">Many a service is met with ingratitude.</seg>
<seg id="1205">好心提供帮助，却遇上了忘恩负义之徒。</seg>
<seg id="1206">THE FLEA AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1206">跳蚤和公牛</seg>
<seg id="1207">A Flea once said to an Ox, "How comes it that a big strong fellow like you is content to serve mankind, and do all their hard work for them, while I, who am no bigger than you see, live on their bodies and drink my fill of their blood, and never do a stroke for it all?"</seg>
<seg id="1207">有一次，跳蚤问公牛：“像你这般高大强壮的家伙，竟然满足于终日为人类服务，为他们付出辛勤的劳动；而像我这样连你都看不清楚的小虫子，却在人类的肉体上生活，毫无顾忌地吸他们的鲜血，什么劳动也不用付出，你怎么会受得了呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1208">To which the Ox replied, "Men are very kind to me, and so I am grateful to them:</seg>
<seg id="1208">公牛回答说：“人类对我很好，所以我很感激他们。</seg>
<seg id="1209">they feed and house me well, and every now and then they show their fondness for me by patting me on the head and neck."</seg>
<seg id="1209">他们给我吃的，给我住的，还经常抚摸、拍打我的头和脖子，以示喜爱。”</seg>
<seg id="1210">"They'd pat me, too," said the Flea, "if I let them:</seg>
<seg id="1210">“他们也打我，”跳蚤说，“如果我愿意挨打的话，</seg>
<seg id="1211">but I take good care they don't, or there would be nothing left of me."</seg>
<seg id="1211">可是，我很小心地不让他们打我，否则，我的小命可就保不住了。”</seg>
<seg id="1212">THE BIRDS, THE BEASTS, AND THE BAT</seg>
<seg id="1212">鸟、兽和蝙蝠</seg>
<seg id="1213">The Birds were at war with the Beasts, and many battles were fought with varying success on either side.</seg>
<seg id="1213">鸟类和野兽开战了，双方各有胜负，都没占到什么便宜。</seg>
<seg id="1214">The Bat did not throw in his lot definitely with either party, but when things went well for the Birds he was found fighting in their ranks;</seg>
<seg id="1214">蝙蝠显然没有明确地加入到任何一方之中，而总是依附强的一方。</seg>
<seg id="1215">when, on the other hand, the Beasts got the upper hand, he was to be found among the Beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1215">当鸟类占上风时，就会发现他在鸟群中；而当兽类占上风时，他又跑到了兽群之中。</seg>
<seg id="1216">No one paid any attention to him while the war lasted:</seg>
<seg id="1216">在战争过程中，谁也没有注意到他。</seg>
<seg id="1217">but when it was over, and peace was restored, neither the Birds nor the Beasts would have anything to do with so double-faced a traitor, and so he remains to this day a solitary outcast from both.</seg>
<seg id="1217">然而，战争一结束，鸟和兽宣告和平相处时，都不想要蝙蝠这样的两面派。所以，从此以后，蝙蝠总在白天躲起来，让双方都看不到他。</seg>
<seg id="1218">THE EAGLE, THE JACKDAW, AND THE SHEPHERD</seg>
<seg id="1218">老鹰、寒鸦和牧羊人</seg>
<seg id="1219">One day a Jackdaw saw an Eagle swoop down on a lamb and carry it off in its talons.</seg>
<seg id="1219">有一天，一只寒鸦看到老鹰从高岩上直飞而下，抓起一只羊羔就飞走了。</seg>
<seg id="1220">"My word," said the Jackdaw, "I'll do that myself."</seg>
<seg id="1220">“我的天呀，”寒鸦说，“我也要试试。”</seg>
<seg id="1221">So it flew high up into the air, and then came shooting down with a great whirring of wings on to the back of a big ram.</seg>
<seg id="1221">于是，他飞上高空，接着又扑腾着翅膀俯冲下来，扑通一声猛扑到一只公羊背上。</seg>
<seg id="1222">It had no sooner alighted than its claws got caught fast in the wool, and nothing it could do was of any use:</seg>
<seg id="1222">刚一飞下来，它的爪子就被羊毛缠住了，无论如何也拔不出来。</seg>
<seg id="1223">there it stuck, flapping away, and only making things worse instead of better.</seg>
<seg id="1223">尽管他使劲拍打着翅膀，可仍然被卡在那里，不但于事无补，反倒更加糟糕了。</seg>
<seg id="1224">By and by up came the Shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="1224">不久，牧羊人走过来了。</seg>
<seg id="1225">"Oho," he said, "so that's what you'd be doing, is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1225">“哦，”他说，“这就是你想做的事情，是吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1226">And he took the Jackdaw, and clipped its wings and carried it home to his children.</seg>
<seg id="1226">他拿起寒鸦，剪断了他的翅膀，带回家给孩子玩。</seg>
<seg id="1227">It looked so odd that they didn't know what to make of it.</seg>
<seg id="1227">寒鸦的样子非常奇怪，孩子们都不知道它是什么东西。</seg>
<seg id="1228">"What sort of bird is it, father?" they asked.</seg>
<seg id="1228">“爸爸，这是一种什么鸟呀？”孩子们问道。</seg>
<seg id="1229">"It's a Jackdaw," he replied, "and nothing but a Jackdaw:</seg>
<seg id="1229">牧羊人回答道：“这是一只寒鸦，只不过是一只寒鸦而已，</seg>
<seg id="1230">but it wants to be taken for an Eagle."</seg>
<seg id="1230">可他却想当一只老鹰。”</seg>
<seg id="1231">If you attempt what is beyond your power, your trouble will be wasted and you court not only misfortune but ridicule.</seg>
<seg id="1231">如果你想做些超出自己能力范围之外的事，不但徒劳无功，还会给自己带来不幸和世人的嘲笑。</seg>
<seg id="1232">THE WOLF AND THE BOY</seg>
<seg id="1232">狼和男孩</seg>
<seg id="1233">A Wolf, who had just enjoyed a good meal and was in a playful mood, caught sight of a Boy lying flat upon the ground, and, realising that he was trying to hide, and that it was fear of himself that made him do this, he went up to him and said, "Aha, I've found you, you see;</seg>
<seg id="1233">刚刚饱餐了一顿的狼正欣喜万分，这时，他看见一个男孩平躺在地上，并且意识到男孩正想藏起来，因为男孩害怕狼。他走到男孩跟前，说：“啊哈，你注意到我发现你了，</seg>
<seg id="1234">but if you can say three things to me, the truth of which cannot be disputed, I will spare your life."</seg>
<seg id="1234">不过，如果你能对我说出三件无可争议的事情来，我就饶了你的命。”</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Boy plucked up courage and thought for a moment, and then he said, "First, it is a pity you saw me;</seg>
<seg id="1235">男孩鼓起勇气，想了一会儿，说：“首先，很可惜，你看见了我；</seg>
<seg id="1236">secondly, I was a fool to let myself be seen;</seg>
<seg id="1236">其次，我很傻，竟然被你看见了；</seg>
<seg id="1237">and thirdly, we all hate wolves because they are always making unprovoked attacks upon our flocks."</seg>
<seg id="1237">第三，我们都讨厌狼，因为他们总会无端攻击我们的羊群。”</seg>
<seg id="1238">The Wolf replied, "Well, what you say is true enough from your point of view;</seg>
<seg id="1238">狼回答说：“嗯，从你的角度来看，你所说的都是事实，</seg>
<seg id="1239">so you may go."</seg>
<seg id="1239">所以你可以走了。”</seg>
<seg id="1240">THE MILLER, HIS SON, AND THEIR ASS</seg>
<seg id="1240">父亲、儿子和驴</seg>
<seg id="1241">A Miller, accompanied by his young Son, was driving his Ass to market in hopes of finding a purchaser for him.</seg>
<seg id="1241">磨坊主和小儿子牵着一头驴到邻近的市场上，希望能给驴找到一个新主人。</seg>
<seg id="1242">On the road they met a troop of girls, laughing and talking, who exclaimed, "Did you ever see such a pair of fools?</seg>
<seg id="1242">在路上，他们遇见了几个女孩子，她们笑着说：“你们看见过这样的傻瓜吗，</seg>
<seg id="1243">To be trudging along the dusty road when they might be riding!"</seg>
<seg id="1243">放着驴不骑，却要在尘土飞扬的路上走！”</seg>
<seg id="1244">The Miller thought there was sense in what they said;</seg>
<seg id="1244">磨坊主心想，她们说得有点道理，</seg>
<seg id="1245">so he made his Son mount the Ass, and himself walked at the side.</seg>
<seg id="1245">于是就让儿子骑上驴，自己则牵着驴走。</seg>
<seg id="1246">Presently they met some of his old cronies, who greeted them and said, "You'll spoil that Son of yours, letting him ride while you toil along on foot!</seg>
<seg id="1246">走了一会，他们遇到了几个老朋友，打过招呼后，朋友们说：“你把儿子宠坏了，竟然让他骑在驴上，而你却在地上辛辛苦苦地走！</seg>
<seg id="1247">Make him walk, young lazybones!</seg>
<seg id="1247">让他下来，这个小懒骨头！</seg>
<seg id="1248">It'll do him all the good in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1248">这样才对他有好处。”</seg>
<seg id="1249">The Miller followed their advice, and took his Son's place on the back of the Ass while the boy trudged along behind.</seg>
<seg id="1249">磨坊主听从了他们的建议，便叫儿子下来，自己骑了上去。</seg>
<seg id="1250">They had not gone far when they overtook a party of women and children, and the Miller heard them say, "What a selfish old man!</seg>
<seg id="1250">没走多远，他们又遇到一群妇女和孩子，磨坊主又听他们说：“这个老头可真自私，</seg>
<seg id="1251">He himself rides in comfort, but lets his poor little boy follow as best he can on his own legs!"</seg>
<seg id="1251">自己舒服地骑在驴上，让那可怜的孩子一路跟着跑！”</seg>
<seg id="1252">So he made his Son get up behind him.</seg>
<seg id="1252">于是，磨坊主立刻又叫儿子坐到他后面。</seg>
<seg id="1253">Further along the road they met some travellers, who asked the Miller whether the Ass he was riding was his own property, or a beast hired for the occasion.</seg>
<seg id="1253">又往前走了一段路后，他们又遇到了几个路人，他们问磨坊主胯下的这头驴子是自己的，还是临时租的。</seg>
<seg id="1254">He replied that it was his own, and that he was taking it to market to sell.</seg>
<seg id="1254">磨坊主说是自己的，正要去市场卖掉驴。</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Good heavens!" said they, "with a load like that the poor beast will be so exhausted by the time he gets there that no one will look at him.</seg>
<seg id="1255">“天啊！”他们说，“驮着你们俩一路走来，这个可怜的牲口看上去已经筋疲力尽了，等它到了市场里，估计没人愿意多看它一眼。</seg>
<seg id="1256">Why, you'd do better to carry him!"</seg>
<seg id="1256">也许你们抬着它去市场更好些！”</seg>
<seg id="1257">"Anything to please you," said the old man, "we can but try."</seg>
<seg id="1257">“只要你高兴就好，”磨坊主说，“我们可以试一下。”</seg>
<seg id="1258">So they got off, tied the Ass's legs together with a rope and slung him on a pole, and at last reached the town, carrying him between them.</seg>
<seg id="1258">于是，他和儿子一起跳下驴，用绳子绑好驴的四条腿，并用一根木棍挑起驴，最后父子俩终于抬着驴来到了镇上。</seg>
<seg id="1259">This was so absurd a sight that the people ran out in crowds to laugh at it, and chaffed the Father and Son unmercifully, some even calling them lunatics.</seg>
<seg id="1259">这个场面有点不寻常，很多人围过来看热闹，大家都取笑他们父子俩，说他们太残酷了，甚至还有人说他们是疯子。</seg>
<seg id="1260">They had then got to a bridge over the river, where the Ass, frightened by the noise and his unusual situation, kicked and struggled till he broke the ropes that bound him, and fell into the water and was drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1260">他们接着要穿过河上的一座桥，就在这时，被吵闹声和自己的奇怪姿势吓呆了的驴，用力挣断了绑缚它的绳子，掉到河里被冲走了。</seg>
<seg id="1261">Whereupon the unfortunate Miller, vexed and ashamed, made the best of his way home again, convinced that in trying to please all he had pleased none, and had lost his Ass into the bargain.</seg>
<seg id="1261">不幸的磨坊主又气愤又羞愧，连忙夺路而逃。他终于信服了一个道理——努力取悦所有人，其实等于谁也没取悦到，反倒还丢了自己的驴。</seg>
<seg id="1262">THE STAG AND THE VINE</seg>
<seg id="1262">牡鹿和葡萄藤</seg>
<seg id="1263">A Stag, pursued by the huntsmen, concealed himself under cover of a thick Vine.</seg>
<seg id="1263">一只鹿为了逃避猎人的追捕，躲藏在一棵茂盛的葡萄藤下。</seg>
<seg id="1264">They lost track of him and passed by his hiding-place without being aware that he was anywhere near.</seg>
<seg id="1264">猎人找不到鹿的踪迹了，虽然刚从葡萄藤旁经过，却并没有发现他。</seg>
<seg id="1265">Supposing all danger to be over, he presently began to browse on the leaves of the Vine.</seg>
<seg id="1265">鹿以为躲过了危险，便旁若无人地开始吃那茂盛的葡萄叶子。</seg>
<seg id="1266">The movement drew the attention of the returning huntsmen, and one of them, supposing some animal to be hidden there, shot an arrow at a venture into the foliage.</seg>
<seg id="1266">这个动静吸引了猎人们的注意，他们马上掉回头来，其中一个人认为叶子底下一定躲着什么动物，一箭就射中了鹿。</seg>
<seg id="1267">The unlucky Stag was pierced to the heart, and, as he expired, he said, "I deserve my fate for my treachery in feeding upon the leaves of my protector."</seg>
<seg id="1267">不幸的鹿被箭刺穿了心脏，临死前说道：“我真是活该，因为我恩将仇报，吃了那曾经救过我一命的葡萄藤。”</seg>
<seg id="1268">Ingratitude sometimes brings its own punishment.</seg>
<seg id="1268">恩将仇报有时会受到更严重的惩罚。</seg>
<seg id="1269">THE LAMB CHASED BY A WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1269">被狼追赶的羊羔</seg>
<seg id="1270">A Wolf was chasing a Lamb, which took refuge in a temple.</seg>
<seg id="1270">一只狼正在追赶一只小羊，而羊逃进了一个神庙里。</seg>
<seg id="1271">The Wolf urged it to come out of the precincts, and said, "If you don't, the priest is sure to catch you and offer you up in sacrifice on the altar."</seg>
<seg id="1271">狼为了怂恿小羊出来，便说：“要是你不赶快出来，祭司就会抓住你，把你放到神坛上当祭祀品。”</seg>
<seg id="1272">To which the Lamb replied, "Thanks, I think I'll stay where I am:</seg>
<seg id="1272">小羊则回答说：“谢谢你，我会一直待在这里，</seg>
<seg id="1273">I'd rather be sacrificed any day than be eaten up by a Wolf."</seg>
<seg id="1273">宁愿有一天能成为祭祀品，也比被你吃掉好。”</seg>
<seg id="1274">THE ARCHER AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1274">射手和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1275">An Archer went up into the hills to get some sport with his bow, and all the animals fled at the sight of him with the exception of the Lion, who stayed behind and challenged him to fight.</seg>
<seg id="1275">从前，有一个神射手到山里去寻找猎物，森林里的野兽一见到他，全都逃得无影无踪，只有高傲的狮子依然待在原地，向他发出挑战。</seg>
<seg id="1276">But he shot an arrow at the Lion and hit him, and said, "There, you see what my messenger can do:</seg>
<seg id="1276">然而，射手冲狮子射出一箭，说：“这只是给你报个信，</seg>
<seg id="1277">just you wait a moment and I'll tackle you myself."</seg>
<seg id="1277">你等着吧，看看我怎么收拾你。”</seg>
<seg id="1278">The Lion, however, when he felt the sting of the arrow, ran away as fast as his legs could carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1278">狮子感觉到箭伤的疼痛后，竭力地快速逃走了。</seg>
<seg id="1279">A fox, who had seen it all happen, said to the Lion, "Come, don't be a coward:</seg>
<seg id="1279">一只在旁观看的狐狸对狮子说：“别做懦夫呀，</seg>
<seg id="1280">why don't you stay and show fight?"</seg>
<seg id="1280">为什么你不待在原地，展示一下你的斗志呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1281">But the Lion replied, "You won't get me to stay, not you:</seg>
<seg id="1281">可是狮子却回答说：“你可不能让我冒死呀，显示斗志的又不是你。</seg>
<seg id="1282">why, when he sends a messenger like that before him, he must himself be a terrible fellow to deal with."</seg>
<seg id="1282">为什么要跑，他射过来的一支箭都这么厉害，他本人肯定也不是一个好对付的家伙。”</seg>
<seg id="1283">Give a wide berth to those who can do damage at a distance.</seg>
<seg id="1283">要对那些从远处就具杀伤力的人敬而远之。</seg>
<seg id="1284">THE WOLF AND THE GOAT</seg>
<seg id="1284">狼和山羊</seg>
<seg id="1285">A Wolf caught sight of a Goat browsing above him on the scanty herbage that grew on the top of a steep rock; and being unable to get at her, tried to induce her to come lower down.</seg>
<seg id="1285">一只狼看见山羊在陡峭的山崖上啃着稀疏的草，自己根本无法捉到她，便怂恿她赶快下来。</seg>
<seg id="1286">"You are risking your life up there, madam, indeed you are," he called out:</seg>
<seg id="1286">“你站在那里会有生命危险的，女士，你太冒险了，”狼喊道，</seg>
<seg id="1287">"pray take my advice and come down here, where you will find plenty of better food."</seg>
<seg id="1287">“还是听我的话，快点下来吧，这里的草更嫩更多，足够你吃的了。”</seg>
<seg id="1288">The Goat turned a knowing eye upon him. "It's little you care whether I get good grass or bad," said she:</seg>
<seg id="1288">山羊带着精明的眼神看着狼，回答说：“你并非真关心我在吃什么样的草，</seg>
<seg id="1289">"what you want is to eat me."</seg>
<seg id="1289">你不过是想吃掉我而已。”</seg>
<seg id="1290">THE SICK STAG</seg>
<seg id="1290">病鹿</seg>
<seg id="1291">A Stag fell sick and lay in a clearing in the forest, too weak to move from the spot.</seg>
<seg id="1291">一只生了病的鹿躺在森林里的一片空地上，虚弱得无力挪动。</seg>
<seg id="1292">When the news of his illness spread, a number of the other beasts came to inquire after his health, and they one and all nibbled a little of the grass that grew round the invalid till at last there was not a blade within his reach.</seg>
<seg id="1292">鹿生病的消息四散开来，众多野兽纷纷前来探望，他们无一例外都会或多或少地吃一点鹿身边生长着的草。最后，在病鹿周围再也看不到一片小草了。</seg>
<seg id="1293">In a few days he began to mend, but was still too feeble to get up and go in search of fodder;</seg>
<seg id="1293">几天后，鹿的身体虽然开始复原了，但是依然十分虚弱，无法站起来出去找东西吃。</seg>
<seg id="1294">and thus he perished miserably of hunger owing to the thoughtlessness of his friends.</seg>
<seg id="1294">终于，他死了，但并非死于疾病，而是不幸地被饿死了，这都是因为朋友们的不体贴而造成的。</seg>
<seg id="1295">THE ASS AND THE MULE</seg>
<seg id="1295">驴和骡子</seg>
<seg id="1296">A certain man who had an Ass and a Mule loaded them both up one day and set out upon a journey.</seg>
<seg id="1296">某人有一头驴和一头骡子，有一天，他把货物分别放在驴和骡子的背上，就出远门了。</seg>
<seg id="1297">So long as the road was fairly level, the Ass got on very well:</seg>
<seg id="1297">只要在平地上走，驴还能应付，</seg>
<seg id="1298">but by and by they came to a place among the hills where the road was very rough and steep, and the Ass was at his last gasp.</seg>
<seg id="1298">但是一走到大山之间那崎岖不平的山路上，驴就上气不接下气了。</seg>
<seg id="1299">So he begged the Mule to relieve him of a part of his load: but the Mule refused.</seg>
<seg id="1299">于是，驴请求骡子替他分担一部分货物，可是，骡子却拒绝了。</seg>
<seg id="1300">At last, from sheer weariness, the Ass stumbled and fell down a steep place and was killed.</seg>
<seg id="1300">由于极度疲倦，驴一不小心从山上滚下去，摔死了。</seg>
<seg id="1301">The driver was in despair, but he did the best he could: he added the Ass's load to the Mule's, and he also flayed the Ass and put his skin on the top of the double load.</seg>
<seg id="1301">赶驴人非常沮丧，但也只能如此，他把驴身上驮的货物放在了骡子的背上，同时还割下了驴皮，一起放在货物顶上。</seg>
<seg id="1302">The Mule could only just manage the extra weight, and, as he staggered painfully along, he said to himself, "I have only got what I deserved:</seg>
<seg id="1302">骡子也只得忍气吞声默默承担着所有重量，他一边蹒跚着前进，一边自言自语：“我真是活该！</seg>
<seg id="1303">if I had been willing to help the Ass at first, I should not now be carrying his load and his skin into the bargain."</seg>
<seg id="1303">如果我一开始就愿意帮助驴分担重量的话，现在也就不会既驮着本该在他背上的货物，又驮着他的皮了。”</seg>
<seg id="1304">BROTHER AND SISTER</seg>
<seg id="1304">哥哥和妹妹</seg>
<seg id="1305">A certain man had two children, a boy and a girl:</seg>
<seg id="1305">某人有两个孩子，一个儿子和一个女儿。</seg>
<seg id="1306">and the boy was as good-looking as the girl was plain.</seg>
<seg id="1306">儿子长相英俊，而女儿却相貌平平。</seg>
<seg id="1307">One day, as they were playing together in their mother's chamber, they chanced upon a mirror and saw their own features for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1307">有一天，兄妹俩在妈妈的房间里玩，偶然走到镜子前，第一次看见了自己的真实面目。</seg>
<seg id="1308">The boy saw what a handsome fellow he was, and began to boast to his Sister about his good looks:</seg>
<seg id="1308">哥哥看到自己是个英俊的小伙子，就开始向妹妹鼓吹自己的相貌；</seg>
<seg id="1309">she, on her part, was ready to cry with vexation when she was aware of her plainness, and took his remarks as an insult to herself.</seg>
<seg id="1309">从妹妹的角度来说，她一看到自己相貌平平，都快要哭出来了，就把哥哥的自夸当成了对自己的嘲笑。</seg>
<seg id="1310">Running to her father, she told him of her Brother's conceit, and accused him of meddling with his mother's things.</seg>
<seg id="1310">她便跑到父亲跟前，抱怨说哥哥太自负了，而且还乱动妈妈的东西。</seg>
<seg id="1311">He laughed and kissed them both, and said, "My children, learn from now onwards to make a good use of the glass.</seg>
<seg id="1311">父亲笑着亲吻了两个孩子，并说：“我的好孩子，今后你们可要好好利用这个镜子。</seg>
<seg id="1312">You, my boy, strive to be as good as it shows you to be handsome;</seg>
<seg id="1312">我的儿子，你可要像自己的英俊相貌一样努力出众；</seg>
<seg id="1313">and you, my girl, resolve to make up for the plainness of your features by the sweetness of your disposition."</seg>
<seg id="1313">我的女儿，可以用你的美德来弥补相貌上的不足。”</seg>
<seg id="1314">THE HEIFER AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1314">小母牛和公牛</seg>
<seg id="1315">A Heifer went up to an Ox, who was straining hard at the plough, and sympathised with him in a rather patronising sort of way on the necessity of his having to work so hard.</seg>
<seg id="1315">一头小母牛走到一头公牛跟前，看见公牛在辛苦地耕田，便以一种居高临下的方式悲叹公牛天生劳苦的可怜命运。</seg>
<seg id="1316">Not long afterwards there was a festival in the village and every one kept holiday:</seg>
<seg id="1316">不久，村子里要举行节日庆祝仪式，所有的人和动物都放假了。</seg>
<seg id="1317">but, whereas the Ox was turned loose into the pasture, the Heifer was seized and led off to sacrifice.</seg>
<seg id="1317">可是，就在公牛被放逐到牧场吃草时，小母牛却被抓去充当祭祀品。</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Ah," said the Ox, with a grim smile, "I see now why you were allowed to have such an idle time:</seg>
<seg id="1318">这时，公牛冷笑道：“喂，现在我知道你为何这么悠闲自得了，</seg>
<seg id="1319">it was because you were always intended for the altar."</seg>
<seg id="1319">因为你天生就要去当祭祀品。”</seg>
<seg id="1320">THE KINGDOM OF THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1320">狮子的王国</seg>
<seg id="1321">When the Lion reigned over the beasts of the earth he was never cruel or tyrannical, but as gentle and just as a King ought to be.</seg>
<seg id="1321">狮子自从统治了地球上的百兽之后，从未施行过任何凶暴、残忍的手段，而是像国王应有的那样公正、仁慈。</seg>
<seg id="1322">During his reign he called a general assembly of the beasts, and drew up a code of laws under which all were to live in perfect equality and harmony:</seg>
<seg id="1322">在统治百兽期间，他曾经召集所有的动物开大会，拟订一个大家都应遵守的法规，便于让动物们公平、和谐地相处。</seg>
<seg id="1323">the wolf and the lamb, the tiger and the stag, the leopard and the kid, the dog and the hare, all should dwell side by side in unbroken peace and friendship.</seg>
<seg id="1323">狼和羊，老虎和鹿，豹子和小山羊，狗和野兔等，大家都应该按照规定友好和睦地相处。</seg>
<seg id="1324">The hare said, "Oh! how I have longed for this day when the weak take their place without fear by the side of the strong!"</seg>
<seg id="1324">兔子说：“哦！这一天，我期盼已久了！这样一来，弱者再也不用惧怕强者了，终于有了自己的一席之地。”</seg>
<seg id="1325">THE ASS AND HIS DRIVER</seg>
<seg id="1325">驴和赶驴人</seg>
<seg id="1326">An Ass was being driven down a mountain road, and after jogging along for a while sensibly enough he suddenly quitted the track and rushed to the edge of a precipice.</seg>
<seg id="1326">某人赶着驴走在下山的路上，一阵小跑之后，驴突然离开大道，冲到了悬崖边。</seg>
<seg id="1327">He was just about to leap over the edge when his Driver caught hold of his tail and did his best to pull him back:</seg>
<seg id="1327">就在驴即将滑下悬崖时，赶驴的人一把抓住他的尾巴，用劲往回拉。</seg>
<seg id="1328">but pull as he might he couldn't get the Ass to budge from the brink.</seg>
<seg id="1328">可是，无论如何也无法将驴从悬崖边拉上来。</seg>
<seg id="1329">At last he gave up, crying, "All right, then, get to the bottom your own way;</seg>
<seg id="1329">最后，赶驴的人放弃了，说道：“好吧，随你去吧，你愿意掉下悬崖，就掉吧，</seg>
<seg id="1330">but it's the way to sudden death, as you'll find out quick enough."</seg>
<seg id="1330">很快你就会发现，这是一条通向死亡的路。”</seg>
<seg id="1331">THE LION AND THE HARE</seg>
<seg id="1331">狮子和野兔</seg>
<seg id="1332">A Lion found a Hare sleeping in her form, and was just going to devour her when he caught sight of a passing stag.</seg>
<seg id="1332">一只狮子发现一只兔子正在窝里睡觉，便想趁机吃掉她。</seg>
<seg id="1333">Dropping the Hare, he at once made for the bigger game;</seg>
<seg id="1333">这时，他又看见旁边有一只鹿经过。狮子立刻丢下兔子，去追赶个头更大的鹿。</seg>
<seg id="1334">but finding, after a long chase, that he could not overtake the stag, he abandoned the attempt and came back for the Hare.</seg>
<seg id="1334">然而，追了一阵子后，狮子发现根本追不上鹿，于是就放弃了目标，又回过头来找兔子。</seg>
<seg id="1335">When he reached the spot, however, he found she was nowhere to be seen, and he had to go without his dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1335">可是，等他回到兔窝时，却发现兔子早已逃之夭夭。这下，他的晚餐全都泡汤了。</seg>
<seg id="1336">"It serves me right," he said; "I should have been content with what I had got, instead of hankering after a better prize."</seg>
<seg id="1336">狮子说：“我真活该！我应该满足于唾手可得的东西，而不应贪心去追求更大的奖励。”</seg>
<seg id="1337">THE WOLVES AND THE DOGS</seg>
<seg id="1337">一群狼和一群狗</seg>
<seg id="1338">Once upon a time the Wolves said to the Dogs, "Why should we continue to be enemies any longer?</seg>
<seg id="1338">从前，有一群狼对一群狗说：“为什么我们要一直成为敌人呢？</seg>
<seg id="1339">You are very like us in most ways:</seg>
<seg id="1339">从各方面来看，你们和我们都很相像，</seg>
<seg id="1340">the main difference between us is one of training only.</seg>
<seg id="1340">咱们之间唯一的区别仅仅是受驯不同而已。</seg>
<seg id="1341">We live a life of freedom; but you are enslaved to mankind, who beat you, and put heavy collars round your necks, and compel you to keep watch over their flocks and herds for them, and, to crown all, they give you nothing but bones to eat.</seg>
<seg id="1341">我们过着自由自在的日子，而你们却成了人类的奴隶，他们不仅鞭打你们，还给你们套上沉重的颈圈，迫使你们去看守羊群和牲畜。总而言之，除了让你们啃骨头之外，人类什么也没给你们。</seg>
<seg id="1342">Don't put up with it any longer, but hand over the flocks to us, and we will all live on the fat of the land and feast together."</seg>
<seg id="1342">别再忍受他们的折磨了，直接把羊群交给我们，我们一起到肥沃的草场里生活吧，我们一起去享受。”</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Dogs allowed themselves to be persuaded by these words, and accompanied the Wolves into their den.</seg>
<seg id="1343">那群狗被狼的一番话说动了心，跟随狼群来到他们的窝里。</seg>
<seg id="1344">But no sooner were they well inside than the Wolves set upon them and tore them to pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1344">结果，刚一进去，狼群就向狗群发起进攻，杀得他们片甲不留。</seg>
<seg id="1345">Traitors richly deserve their fate.</seg>
<seg id="1345">背叛者通常都没有好下场。</seg>
<seg id="1346">THE BULL AND THE CALF</seg>
<seg id="1346">公牛和小牛</seg>
<seg id="1347">A full-grown Bull was struggling to force his huge bulk through the narrow entrance to a cow-house where his stall was, when a young Calf came up and said to him, "If you'll step aside a moment, I'll show you the way to get through."</seg>
<seg id="1347">一头公牛竭尽全力要挤过一道窄门到牛棚里去，他的牛栏就在棚里。这时，一头小牛犊走了过来，对公牛说：“如果你能闪到一边去，我就告诉你怎么过去。”</seg>
<seg id="1348">The Bull turned upon him an amused look. "I knew that way," said he, "before you were born."</seg>

<seg id="1350">A Woodman went into the forest and begged of the Trees the favour of a handle for his Axe.</seg>
<seg id="1350">一个樵夫走进森林里，请求树给他一根木头做斧柄。</seg>
<seg id="1351">The principal Trees at once agreed to so modest a request, and unhesitatingly gave him a young ash sapling, out of which he fashioned the handle he desired.</seg>
<seg id="1351">树的首领马上就答应了樵夫那温和谦逊的请求，毫不犹豫地给了他一根小树枝。樵夫用小树枝做成了自己想要的斧柄。</seg>
<seg id="1352">No sooner had he done so than he set to work to fell the noblest Trees in the wood.</seg>
<seg id="1352">刚一完成这个任务，他接着就在森林里用斧头砍起其中最贵重的一棵大树。</seg>
<seg id="1353">When they saw the use to which he was putting their gift, they cried, "Alas! alas!</seg>
<seg id="1353">当树看到樵夫用的正是自己给他的礼物时，说：“哎呀，哎呀！</seg>
<seg id="1354">We are undone, but we are ourselves to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1354">我们是自己葬送了自己。</seg>
<seg id="1355">The little we gave has cost us all:</seg>
<seg id="1355">给他的那一根小树枝，竟然葬送了我们大家的命。</seg>
<seg id="1356">had we not sacrificed the rights of the ash, we might ourselves have stood for ages."</seg>
<seg id="1356">要是我们没给它，也许我们还能在这里多站几年。”</seg>
<seg id="1357">THE ASTRONOMER</seg>
<seg id="1357">天文学家</seg>
<seg id="1358">There was once an Astronomer whose habit it was to go out at night and observe the stars.</seg>
<seg id="1358">有一个天文学家养成了晚上出去观察星象的习惯。</seg>
<seg id="1359">One night, as he was walking about outside the town gates, gazing up absorbed into the sky and not looking where he was going, he fell into a dry well.</seg>
<seg id="1359">有一个夜晚，当他走出城门来到郊外后，便聚精会神地观察着天空，一不小心掉进一口枯井里。</seg>
<seg id="1360">As he lay there groaning, some one passing by heard him, and, coming to the edge of the well, looked down and, on learning what had happened, said, "If you really mean to say that you were looking so hard at the sky that you didn't even see where your feet were carrying you along the ground, it appears to me that you deserve all you've got."</seg>
<seg id="1360">当他正坐在井里呻吟时，一个刚好从旁经过的人听到了，便走到井边向下看，待了解了事情经过后，对他说：“如果真如你所说，只是一味地努力向上看，而没有看清楚脚下的路况，那么在我看来，你就活该待在这里。”</seg>

<seg id="1363">The father was beside himself with grief, and in his anger against the Snake he caught up an axe and went and stood close to the Snake's hole, and watched for a chance of killing it.</seg>
<seg id="1363">悲痛气愤之余，工人抓起一把斧头，气冲冲地跑到蛇洞外，等待机会砍死蛇。</seg>
<seg id="1364">Presently the Snake came out, and the man aimed a blow at it, but only succeeded in cutting off the tip of its tail before it wriggled in again.</seg>
<seg id="1364">不久，蛇从洞里出来了，工人立即一斧头砍过去，可是只砍断了它的尾巴尖。</seg>
<seg id="1365">He then tried to get it to come out a second time, pretending that he wished to make up the quarrel.</seg>
<seg id="1365">随后，工人还想再如法炮制，便假装想与蛇和解。</seg>
<seg id="1366">But the Snake said, "I can never be your friend because of my lost tail, nor you mine because of your lost child."</seg>
<seg id="1366">可是，蛇却说：“我永远也无法成为你的朋友，因为我丢了自己的尾巴，而你却丢失了儿子。”</seg>
<seg id="1367">Injuries are never forgotten in the presence of those who caused them.</seg>

<seg id="1369">A Singing-bird was confined in a cage which hung outside a window, and had a way of singing at night when all other birds were asleep.</seg>
<seg id="1369">一只画眉鸟被囚禁在窗外挂着的一个笼子里，当其他鸟儿都酣睡时，她却在夜里歌唱。</seg>
<seg id="1370">One night a Bat came and clung to the bars of the cage, and asked the Bird why she was silent by day and sang only at night.</seg>
<seg id="1370">有一个夜晚，蝙蝠飞过来，抓住鸟笼的栅栏，问她为什么白天默默无声，却在夜间放声歌唱。</seg>
<seg id="1371">"I have a very good reason for doing so," said the Bird:</seg>
<seg id="1371">小鸟回答说：“我这样做是有道理的，</seg>
<seg id="1372">"it was once when I was singing in the daytime that a fowler was attracted by my voice, and set his nets for me and caught me.</seg>
<seg id="1372">曾经有一次，当我在白天唱歌时，一个捕鸟人被我的歌声吸引，就用鸟笼子捉住了我。</seg>
<seg id="1373">Since then I have never sung except by night."</seg>
<seg id="1373">从此我只在夜里唱歌。”</seg>
<seg id="1374">But the Bat replied, "It is no use your doing that now when you are a prisoner:</seg>
<seg id="1374">可是，蝙蝠却说：“你现在这样做根本没用了，因为你已经成为了阶下囚。</seg>
<seg id="1375">if only you had done so before you were caught, you might still have been free."</seg>
<seg id="1375">若是在被捉住之前这样做就好了，那样或许你依然是自由之身！”</seg>

<seg id="1377">驴和他的买主</seg>
<seg id="1378">A Man who wanted to buy an Ass went to market, and, coming across a likely-looking beast, arranged with the owner that he should be allowed to take him home on trial to see what he was like.</seg>
<seg id="1378">有个人想买一头驴，于是，他来到市场里。有一群貌似一样的畜生被主人牵着向他走来，他提出应该将驴牵回家，好检验一下驴的状况。</seg>
<seg id="1379">When he reached home, he put him into his stable along with the other asses.</seg>
<seg id="1379">回到家后，他把驴安置在马棚里，里面还混杂着其他牲口。</seg>
<seg id="1380">The newcomer took a look round, and immediately went and chose a place next to the laziest and greediest beast in the stable.</seg>
<seg id="1380">驴环视了一下四周，立刻来到马棚里一头好吃懒做的驴旁边。</seg>
<seg id="1381">When the master saw this he put a halter on him at once, and led him off and handed him over to his owner again.</seg>
<seg id="1381">主人见此，立刻给那头驴套上辔头，牵去还给驴的卖主。</seg>
<seg id="1382">The latter was a good deal surprised to see him back so soon, and said, "Why, do you mean to say you have tested him already?"</seg>
<seg id="1382">看到他们这么快就回来了，卖主很惊讶，就说：“为什么回来了？</seg>
<seg id="1383">"I don't want to put him through any more tests," replied the other:</seg>
<seg id="1383">你已经检验过它了？”那人答道：</seg>
<seg id="1384">"I could see what sort of beast he is from the companion he chose for himself."</seg>
<seg id="1384">“我可不想再做什么检验了，从它选择的同伴来看，我就已经知道它是什么样的牲口了。”</seg>

<seg id="1385">物以类聚，人以群分。</seg>

<seg id="1387">一只从羊群里掉队的小山羊，被狼所追赶。</seg>
<seg id="1388">When he saw he must be caught he turned round and said to the Wolf, "I know, sir, that I can't escape being eaten by you:</seg>
<seg id="1388">当小山羊感觉自己就快被抓住了时，他回过头来，对狼说：“狼啊，我知道逃不掉了，很快就会成为你的盘中餐，</seg>
<seg id="1389">and so, as my life is bound to be short, I pray you let it be as merry as may be.</seg>
<seg id="1389">因为我的生命很短暂，求求你让我尽可能地灿烂一回吧。</seg>
<seg id="1390">Will you not play me a tune to dance to before I die?"</seg>
<seg id="1390">你能在我死之前吹一曲，让我跳一次舞吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wolf saw no objection to having some music before his dinner:</seg>
<seg id="1391">狼心想在晚餐前听一支曲子也不错，</seg>
<seg id="1392">so he took out his pipe and began to play, while the Kid danced before him.</seg>
<seg id="1392">于是，他拿出自己的笛子来，开始吹奏，而小山羊则在他面前跳起舞来。</seg>
<seg id="1393">Before many minutes were passed the gods who guarded the flock heard the sound and came up to see what was going on.</seg>
<seg id="1393">还没过几分钟，守护羊群的牧羊犬闻声而至，想探个究竟。</seg>
<seg id="1394">They no sooner clapped eyes on the Wolf than they gave chase and drove him away.</seg>
<seg id="1394">牧羊犬一看到狼，便马上赶走了他。</seg>
<seg id="1395">As he ran off, he turned and said to the Kid, "It's what I thoroughly deserve:</seg>
<seg id="1395">狼一边跑，一边回过头来对小山羊说：“我真活该，</seg>
<seg id="1396">my trade is the butcher's, and I had no business to turn piper to please you."</seg>
<seg id="1396">我本该杀了你，根本没有义务为你吹笛子取悦你呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1397">THE DEBTOR AND HIS SOW</seg>
<seg id="1397">欠债人和母猪</seg>
<seg id="1398">A Man of Athens fell into debt and was pressed for the money by his creditor;</seg>
<seg id="1398">一个雅典人欠了别人的钱，债主三番五次来催他还钱，但他当时根本没有办法还钱，所以请求延期几天。</seg>
<seg id="1399">but he had no means of paying at the time, so he begged for delay.</seg>
<seg id="1399">可是，债主却不答应，让他立刻还钱。</seg>
<seg id="1400">But the creditor refused and said he must pay at once.</seg>
<seg id="1400">迫不得已，欠债人把家中仅有的母猪带到市场上去卖。</seg>
<seg id="1401">Then the Debtor fetched a Sow--the only one he had--and took her to market to offer her for sale.</seg>
<seg id="1401">碰巧，债主也在那个市场里。</seg>
<seg id="1402">It happened that his creditor was there too.</seg>
<seg id="1402">过了一会儿，有一个买主走上前来，问这头猪是否还能下小猪崽。</seg>
<seg id="1403">"Yes," said the Debtor, "very fine ones;</seg>
<seg id="1403">“当然了，”欠债人回答说，“能生下很好的小猪崽，</seg>
<seg id="1404">and the remarkable thing is that she produces females at the Mysteries and males at the Panathenea."</seg>
<seg id="1404">而且更惊人的是，她还能在女神节生下小母猪，在帕纳西尼亚节生下小公猪。”</seg>
<seg id="1405">(Festivals these were: and the Athenians always sacrifice a sow at one, and a boar at the other;</seg>
<seg id="1405">（这是希腊的两个节日，雅典人总是在女神节杀一只小母猪祭祀，在帕纳西尼亚节杀一只小公猪祭祀，</seg>
<seg id="1406">while at the Dionysia they sacrifice a kid.)</seg>
<seg id="1406">而在狂欢节杀一只小山羊做祭祀品。）</seg>
<seg id="1407">At that the creditor, who was standing by, put in, "Don't be surprised, sir;</seg>
<seg id="1407">债主听到他说的话，立刻站出来插话道：“一点都不奇怪，先生，</seg>
<seg id="1408">why, still better, at the Dionysia this Sow has kids!"</seg>
<seg id="1408">为什么呢，因为更厉害的是，在狂欢节时，她还会生下小山羊呢！”</seg>
<seg id="1409">THE BALD HUNTSMAN</seg>
<seg id="1409">秃头的猎人</seg>
<seg id="1410">A Man who had lost all his hair took to wearing a wig, and one day he went out hunting.</seg>
<seg id="1410">有一个人因为所有的头发都掉光了，便戴上了一顶假发。有一天，他出去打猎。</seg>
<seg id="1411">It was blowing rather hard at the time, and he hadn't gone far before a gust of wind caught his hat and carried it off, and his wig too, much to the amusement of the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="1411">突然，一阵狂风吹来，把他头上的帽子和假发一起吹跑了，此事成了狩猎活动中的一大乐事。</seg>
<seg id="1412">But he quite entered into the joke, and said, "Ah, well! the hair that wig is made of didn't stick to the head on which it grew;</seg>
<seg id="1412">然而，他本人说出来的话就更加可笑了：“哈哈，好吧，制成这顶假发的那些头发，早已不能固定在原主人的头上了，</seg>
<seg id="1413">so it's no wonder it won't stick to mine."</seg>
<seg id="1413">所以毫无疑问，它们也无法粘在我的头上。”</seg>
<seg id="1414">THE HERDSMAN AND THE LOST BULL</seg>
<seg id="1414">牧人和丢失的公牛</seg>
<seg id="1415">A Herdsman was tending his cattle when he missed a young Bull, one of the finest of the herd.</seg>
<seg id="1415">一个牧人在给牛喂草时发现丢了一头小公牛，那可是其中最好的一头牛。</seg>
<seg id="1416">He went at once to look for him, but, meeting with no success in his search, he made a vow that, if he should discover the thief, he would sacrifice a calf to Jupiter.</seg>
<seg id="1416">他立刻出去找牛，可是哪里都找不到，便发下誓言，只要让他发现偷牛的贼，他就会杀一头小牛供奉朱庇特。</seg>
<seg id="1417">Continuing his search, he entered a thicket, where he presently espied a lion devouring the lost Bull.</seg>
<seg id="1417">牧人继续去找他的牛，走着走着来到了一个灌木丛中，他忽然看见一只狮子正在津津有味地吃着那头丢失了的小公牛。</seg>
<seg id="1418">Terrified with fear, he raised his hands to heaven and cried, "Great Jupiter, I vowed I would sacrifice a calf to thee if I should discover the thief:</seg>
<seg id="1418">他吓呆了，立刻举起双手向上天祈求说：“伟大的朱庇特，刚才我曾立誓，如果捉到贼，愿意献上一头小牛供奉你；</seg>
<seg id="1419">but now a full-grown Bull I promise thee if only I myself escape unhurt from his clutches."</seg>
<seg id="1419">但是现在，如果我可以安全地脱离狮口，我愿意再奉献一头成熟强壮的牛。”</seg>
<seg id="1420">THE MULE</seg>
<seg id="1420">骡子</seg>
<seg id="1421">One morning a Mule, who had too much to eat and too little to do, began to think himself a very fine fellow indeed, and frisked about saying, "My father was undoubtedly a high-spirited horse and I take after him entirely."</seg>
<seg id="1421">一天清晨，一匹衣食无忧、悠闲自在的骡子，认为自己天生好命，便高兴地自言自语道：“我的父亲一定是一匹能奔善跑的马，我非常像他。”</seg>
<seg id="1422">But very soon afterwards he was put into the harness and compelled to go a very long way with a heavy load behind him.</seg>
<seg id="1422">然而，话音刚落，他就被套上马具，驮着沉重的货物上路了。</seg>
<seg id="1423">At the end of the day, exhausted by his unusual exertions, he said dejectedly to himself, "I must have been mistaken about my father;</seg>
<seg id="1423">一天下来，骡子已被那不同寻常的工作累垮了，他愁眉苦脸地说：“关于父亲的出身，我可能想错了，</seg>
<seg id="1424">he can only have been an ass after all."</seg>
<seg id="1424">他不过是一头苦命的驴而已。”</seg>
<seg id="1425">THE HOUND AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1425">猎狗和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1426">A Hound, roaming in the forest, spied a lion, and being well used to lesser game, gave chase, thinking he would make a fine quarry.</seg>
<seg id="1426">有一条猎狗，正在森林里闲逛，猛然看见一只狮子，心想这可是一个不错的猎物，便追了上去，想施展一下自己的小伎俩。</seg>
<seg id="1427">Presently the lion perceived that he was being pursued;</seg>
<seg id="1427">很快，狮子觉察到自己被追踪了，</seg>
<seg id="1428">so, stopping short, he rounded on his pursuer and gave a loud roar.</seg>
<seg id="1428">便突然停住，回过头来冲着追捕者大声吼叫。</seg>
<seg id="1429">The Hound immediately turned tail and fled.</seg>
<seg id="1429">猎狗立刻转身逃跑了。</seg>
<seg id="1430">A Fox, seeing him running away, jeered at him and said, "Ho! ho!</seg>
<seg id="1430">一只狐狸见状，便嘲笑起猎狗：“呵呵，</seg>
<seg id="1431">There goes the coward who chased a lion and ran away the moment he roared!"</seg>
<seg id="1431">真是个胆小鬼，竟然还敢追狮子，只要狮子一声吼，你可就落荒而逃了！”</seg>
<seg id="1432">THE FATHER AND HIS DAUGHTERS</seg>
<seg id="1432">父亲和他的女儿</seg>
<seg id="1433">A Man had two Daughters, one of whom he gave in marriage to a gardener, and the other to a potter.</seg>
<seg id="1433">某人有两个女儿，一个嫁给了园丁，另一个嫁给了陶艺人。</seg>
<seg id="1434">After a time he thought he would go and see how they were getting on;</seg>
<seg id="1434">过了些日子，父亲心想应该去看看女儿们的生活如何。</seg>
<seg id="1435">and first he went to the gardener's wife.</seg>
<seg id="1435">于是，他先来到嫁给园丁的女儿家里，</seg>
<seg id="1436">He asked her how she was, and how things were going with herself and her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1436">他问女儿生活过得怎么样，她的丈夫又过得怎么样。</seg>
<seg id="1437">She replied that on the whole they were doing very well:</seg>
<seg id="1437">女儿回答说一切都很好，</seg>
<seg id="1438">"But," she continued, "I do wish we could have some good heavy rain:</seg>
<seg id="1438">“但是，”她又补充道，“我真希望能下场大雨，</seg>
<seg id="1439">the garden wants it badly."</seg>
<seg id="1439">园子里太需要水了。”</seg>
<seg id="1440">Then he went on to the potter's wife and made the same inquiries of her.</seg>
<seg id="1440">接着，他又来到嫁给陶艺人的女儿家里，问了同样的问题。</seg>
<seg id="1441">She replied that she and her husband had nothing to complain of:</seg>
<seg id="1441">女儿说她和丈夫什么都不缺，</seg>
<seg id="1442">"But," she went on, "I do wish we could have some nice dry weather, to dry the pottery."</seg>
<seg id="1442">“可是，”她继续说，“我只希望能有个阳光充足的好天气，好让陶器快点干。”</seg>
<seg id="1443">Her Father looked at her with a humorous expression on his face.</seg>
<seg id="1443">父亲带着滑稽的表情看着女儿，</seg>
<seg id="1444">"You want dry weather," he said, "and your sister wants rain.</seg>
<seg id="1444">对她说：“你希望出太阳，而你的姐姐却盼着下雨，</seg>
<seg id="1445">I was going to ask in my prayers that your wishes should be granted;</seg>
<seg id="1445">我本想祈祷让你的愿望也成真，</seg>
<seg id="1446">but now it strikes me I had better not refer to the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1446">可是现在，我认为自己最好什么也不管了。”</seg>
<seg id="1447">THE THIEF AND THE INNKEEPER</seg>
<seg id="1447">小偷和店主</seg>
<seg id="1448">A Thief hired a room at an inn, and stayed there some days on the look-out for something to steal.</seg>
<seg id="1448">一个小偷在旅馆里租了一间房，一连住了好几天，想要偷一点东西。</seg>
<seg id="1449">No opportunity, however, presented itself, till one day, when there was a festival to be celebrated, the Innkeeper appeared in a fine new coat and sat down before the door of the inn for an airing.</seg>
<seg id="1449">可是，一直没找到机会。直到有一天，人们要庆祝某个节日，老板穿着一件漂亮的新衣坐在门口透气。</seg>
<seg id="1450">The Thief no sooner set eyes upon the coat than he longed to get possession of it.</seg>
<seg id="1450">小偷很快就盯上了那件新衣服，想据为己有。</seg>
<seg id="1451">There was no business doing, so he went and took a seat by the side of the Innkeeper, and began talking to him.</seg>
<seg id="1451">店里也没有什么生意，小偷便走过去坐在老板旁边，与他闲谈起来。</seg>
<seg id="1452">They conversed together for some time, and then the Thief suddenly yawned and howled like a wolf.</seg>
<seg id="1452">聊了一会儿，小偷突然打了一个呵欠，并像狼似的大吼了一声。</seg>
<seg id="1453">The Innkeeper asked him in some concern what ailed him.</seg>
<seg id="1453">旅馆老板关切地问他这是怎么了。</seg>
<seg id="1454">The Thief replied, "I will tell you about myself, sir, but first I must beg you to take charge of my clothes for me, for I intend to leave them with you.</seg>
<seg id="1454">小偷回答说：“我会告诉你有关我的事情，但是首先，请你负责照看一下我的衣服，因为我想把这些都留给你。</seg>
<seg id="1455">Why I have these fits of yawning I cannot tell:</seg>
<seg id="1455">我自己也不知道为什么要这样打呵欠，</seg>
<seg id="1456">maybe they are sent as a punishment for my misdeeds;</seg>
<seg id="1456">可能是对过去所犯恶行的一种惩罚吧。</seg>
<seg id="1457">but, whatever the reason, the facts are that when I have yawned three times I become a ravening wolf and fly at men's throats."</seg>
<seg id="1457">不过，无论是什么原因，实际上，等我第三次打呵欠时，就会变成一只狼，扑向人的喉咙。”</seg>
<seg id="1458">As he finished speaking he yawned a second time and howled again as before.</seg>
<seg id="1458">说完之后，他又打了第二个呵欠，接着就像第一次一样大吼了一声。</seg>
<seg id="1459">The Innkeeper, believing every word he said, and terrified at the prospect of being confronted with a wolf, got up hastily and started to run indoors;</seg>
<seg id="1459">旅馆老板完全信以为真，一想到即将要面对一只狼，心里就很害怕。他立刻站起身来，准备夺门而逃。</seg>
<seg id="1460">but the Thief caught him by the coat and tried to stop him, crying, "Stay, sir, stay, and take charge of my clothes, or else I shall never see them again."</seg>
<seg id="1460">小偷扯住他的外衣，想留下他，并说：“先生，请等一等，拿走我的衣服吧，不然我再也看不到它们了。”</seg>
<seg id="1461">As he spoke he opened his mouth and began to yawn for the third time.</seg>
<seg id="1461">刚一说完，他又张开嘴，准备打第三个呵欠。</seg>
<seg id="1462">The Innkeeper, mad with the fear of being eaten by a wolf, slipped out of his coat, which remained in the other's hands, and bolted into the inn and locked the door behind him;</seg>
<seg id="1462">旅馆老板快被吓疯了，便赶紧从被小偷抓住的外套里溜出来，逃进旅馆里并锁上了门，</seg>
<seg id="1463">and the Thief then quietly stole off with his spoil.</seg>
<seg id="1463">而小偷则带着他夺来的战利品悄悄地溜走了。</seg>
<seg id="1464">THE PACK-ASS AND THE WILD ASS</seg>

<seg id="1465">A Wild Ass, who was wandering idly about, one day came upon a Pack-Ass lying at full length in a sunny spot and thoroughly enjoying himself.</seg>
<seg id="1465">有一天，一头无所事事的野驴，看见一头家驴正舒适地躺在阳光充足的地方自娱自乐。</seg>
<seg id="1466">Going up to him, he said, "What a lucky beast you are!</seg>
<seg id="1466">他走了过去，说：“你可真幸运呀！</seg>
<seg id="1467">Your sleek coat shows how well you live:</seg>
<seg id="1467">从你那光滑的皮肤就能看出来，你的日子过得很舒服呀，</seg>
<seg id="1468">how I envy you!"</seg>
<seg id="1468">我真羡慕你！”</seg>
<seg id="1469">Not long after the Wild Ass saw his acquaintance again, but this time he was carrying a heavy load, and his driver was following behind and beating him with a thick stick.</seg>
<seg id="1469">不久，野驴又看见家驴驮着沉重的货物，驴夫还跟在后面不停地用鞭子抽打他，</seg>
<seg id="1470">"Ah, my friend," said the Wild Ass, "I don't envy you any more:</seg>
<seg id="1470">这一次，野驴说：“我的朋友，我不再羡慕你了，</seg>
<seg id="1471">for I see you pay dear for your comforts."</seg>
<seg id="1471">因为我知道你付出了惨痛的代价。”</seg>
<seg id="1472">Advantages that are dearly bought are doubtful blessings.</seg>
<seg id="1472">用昂贵代价换来的优势是令人怀疑的福气。</seg>
<seg id="1473">THE ASS AND HIS MASTERS</seg>
<seg id="1473">驴和他的主人们</seg>
<seg id="1474">A Gardener had an Ass which had a very hard time of it, what with scanty food, heavy loads, and constant beating.</seg>
<seg id="1474">有一头生活在园丁家里的驴，过着艰辛的日子，不仅吃得少、干得多，还经常挨主人的鞭打。</seg>
<seg id="1475">The Ass therefore begged Jupiter to take him away from the Gardener and hand him over to another master.</seg>
<seg id="1475">于是，驴请求朱庇特让他离开园丁，换另外一个主人。</seg>
<seg id="1476">So Jupiter sent Mercury to the Gardener to bid him sell the Ass to a Potter, which he did.</seg>
<seg id="1476">于是朱庇特派墨丘利去找园丁，让他把驴卖给一个陶艺工人，园丁照做了。</seg>
<seg id="1477">But the Ass was as discontented as ever, for he had to work harder than before:</seg>
<seg id="1477">然而，驴仍然像以前一样不满足，因为他现在过得比以前还辛苦。</seg>
<seg id="1478">so he begged Jupiter for relief a second time, and Jupiter very obligingly arranged that he should be sold to a Tanner.</seg>
<seg id="1478">于是，他又请求朱庇特让自己离开第二个主人，再换另外一个。朱庇特又安排第二个主人把他卖给一个皮匠。</seg>
<seg id="1479">But when the Ass saw what his new master's trade was, he cried in despair, "Why wasn't I content to serve either of my former masters, hard as I had to work and badly as I was treated?</seg>
<seg id="1479">可是，当驴一看到新主人的生意，就绝望地哭起来：“为什么我总对以前的主人不满意呀！为什么不满足于自己的辛苦工作和微薄待遇呀？</seg>
<seg id="1480">for they would have buried me decently, but now I shall come in the end to the tanning-vat."</seg>
<seg id="1480">至少，我会慢慢地消耗至死，而现在，我就要在制皮桶里结束性命了。”</seg>
<seg id="1481">Servants don't know a good master till they have served a worse.</seg>
<seg id="1481">到了更坏的主人那里，才知道前主人的好。</seg>
<seg id="1482">THE PACK-ASS, THE WILD ASS, AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1482">家驴、野驴和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1483">A Wild Ass saw a Pack-Ass jogging along under a heavy load, and taunted him with the condition of slavery in which he lived, in these words: "What a vile lot is yours compared with mine!</seg>
<seg id="1483">一头野驴看到一头家驴背负着沉重的货物一路小跑，便讥讽他过着奴隶般的生活：“和我相比，你过得多么卑微呀！</seg>
<seg id="1484">I am free as the air, and never do a stroke of work;</seg>
<seg id="1484">我自由自在地享受着大自然，从不下苦力，</seg>
<seg id="1485">and, as for fodder, I have only to go to the hills and there I find far more than enough for my needs.</seg>
<seg id="1485">说到食物，我只需要跑到山上去，就能发现大量吃的东西。</seg>
<seg id="1486">But you!</seg>
<seg id="1486">再看看你！</seg>
<seg id="1487">you depend on your master for food, and he makes you carry heavy loads every day and beats you unmercifully."</seg>
<seg id="1487">只能依靠主人施舍点吃的，他不仅每天都让你驮重物，还无情地鞭打你。”</seg>
<seg id="1488">At that moment a Lion appeared on the scene, and made no attempt to molest the Pack-Ass owing to the presence of the driver;</seg>
<seg id="1488">这时，一只狮子出现在他们视野中，由于驴夫的出现，狮子没有骚扰家驴，</seg>
<seg id="1489">but he fell upon the Wild Ass, who had no one to protect him, and without more ado made a meal of him.</seg>
<seg id="1489">直接扑向了没有保护者的野驴，立即吃掉了野驴。</seg>
<seg id="1490">It is no use being your own master unless you can stand up for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1490">除非能照顾好自己，否则做自己的主人一点儿用也没有。</seg>
<seg id="1491">THE ANT</seg>
<seg id="1491">蚂蚁</seg>
<seg id="1492">Ants were once men and made their living by tilling the soil.</seg>
<seg id="1492">很久很久以前，蚂蚁本来是人，以耕地为生。</seg>
<seg id="1493">But, not content with the results of their own work, they were always casting longing eyes upon the crops and fruits of their neighbours, which they stole, whenever they got the chance, and added to their own store.</seg>
<seg id="1493">但是，他们不满足于自己的劳动所得，总是盯着邻居的水果和庄稼羡慕不已，只要一有机会，他们就会偷邻居的食物，放在自己的储藏室。</seg>
<seg id="1494">At last their covetousness made Jupiter so angry that he changed them into Ants.</seg>
<seg id="1494">后来，他们的贪婪让朱庇特十分生气，便把他们变成了现在的蚂蚁。</seg>
<seg id="1495">But, though their forms were changed, their nature remained the same:</seg>
<seg id="1495">然而，虽然他们的模样改变了，本性却依然未变。</seg>
<seg id="1496">and so, to this day, they go about among the cornfields and gather the fruits of others' labour, and store them up for their own use.</seg>
<seg id="1496">直到现在，他们仍然会到别人的田里采集人家的劳动成果，贮存起来留作自己的食物。</seg>
<seg id="1497">You may punish a thief, but his bent remains.</seg>
<seg id="1497">你可以惩罚小偷，但他们的恶习依然如故。</seg>
<seg id="1498">THE FROGS AND THE WELL</seg>
<seg id="1498">青蛙和水井</seg>
<seg id="1499">Two Frogs lived together in a marsh.</seg>
<seg id="1499">两只青蛙住在一片沼泽地里。</seg>
<seg id="1500">But one hot summer the marsh dried up, and they left it to look for another place to live in: for frogs like damp places if they can get them.</seg>
<seg id="1500">在一个炎热的夏季，沼泽地干涸了，他们不得不去寻找另一块湿地，因为他们很喜欢潮湿的地方。</seg>
<seg id="1501">By and by they came to a deep well, and one of them looked down into it, and said to the other, "This looks a nice cool place:</seg>
<seg id="1501">不久，他们找到了一口深井，其中一只青蛙向下看了看，对另一只说：“看上去，这是个凉快的好地方，</seg>
<seg id="1502">let us jump in and settle here."</seg>
<seg id="1502">我们跳进去，就住在这里吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1503">But the other, who had a wiser head on his shoulders, replied, "Not so fast, my friend: supposing this well dried up like the marsh, how should we get out again?"</seg>
<seg id="1503">而另一只青蛙头脑比较聪明，回答说：“别着急，朋友，如果这口井也干了的话，我们可怎么出来呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1504">Think twice before you act.</seg>
<seg id="1504">凡事应三思而后行。</seg>
<seg id="1505">THE CRAB AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1505">螃蟹和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1506">A Crab once left the sea-shore and went and settled in a meadow some way inland, which looked very nice and green and seemed likely to be a good place to feed in.</seg>
<seg id="1506">有一次，一只螃蟹离开海边，定居在内陆的一块草地上，那里看着很美，有青青的绿草，是个养分充足的好地方。</seg>
<seg id="1507">But a hungry Fox came along and spied the Crab and caught him.</seg>
<seg id="1507">然而，一只饥饿的狐狸走过来，看见螃蟹并捉住了他。</seg>
<seg id="1508">Just as he was going to be eaten up, the Crab said, "This is just what I deserve;</seg>
<seg id="1508">就在狐狸将要吃掉他之前，螃蟹说：“我真是活该！</seg>
<seg id="1509">for I had no business to leave my natural home by the sea and settle here as though I belonged to the land."</seg>
<seg id="1509">我没有理由要离开海边那个天然的家，像陆地栖息的动物一样，偏要到这里来定居。”</seg>
<seg id="1510">Be content with your lot.</seg>
<seg id="1510">知足才能常乐。</seg>
<seg id="1511">THE FOX AND THE GRASSHOPPER</seg>
<seg id="1511">狐狸和蚂蚱</seg>
<seg id="1512">A Grasshopper sat chirping in the branches of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1512">一只蚂蚱坐在树枝上叽叽喳喳地鸣唱。</seg>
<seg id="1513">A Fox heard her, and, thinking what a dainty morsel she would make, he tried to get her down by a trick.</seg>
<seg id="1513">一只狐狸听到她的叫声，心想这可是一顿美餐呀，便想出了一个诡计诱使蚂蚱下来。</seg>
<seg id="1514">Standing below in full view of her, he praised her song in the most flattering terms, and begged her to descend, saying he would like to make the acquaintance of the owner of so beautiful a voice.</seg>
<seg id="1514">他站在树下一个能完全看见蚂蚱的地方，用尽各种方法赞美蚂蚱的歌声悦耳动听，并劝蚂蚱下来，想要看一看是什么样的动物才能发出如此悦耳的声音。</seg>
<seg id="1515">But she was not to be taken in, and replied, "You are very much mistaken, my dear sir, if you imagine I am going to come down:</seg>
<seg id="1515">可是，蚂蚱识破了他的诡计，回答说：“喂，若是你以为我会飞下来，那就大错特错了。</seg>
<seg id="1516">I keep well out of the way of you and your kind ever since the day when I saw numbers of grasshoppers' wings strewn about the entrance to a fox's earth."</seg>
<seg id="1516">自从那天见到狐狸的洞口四周散布着无数蚂蚱的翅膀之后，我就开始警惕着你和你的同类了。”</seg>
<seg id="1517">THE FARMER, HIS BOY, AND THE ROOKS</seg>
<seg id="1517">农夫、伙计和白嘴鸦</seg>
<seg id="1518">A Farmer had just sown a field of wheat, and was keeping a careful watch over it, for numbers of Rooks and starlings kept continually settling on it and eating up the grain.</seg>
<seg id="1518">一个农夫刚刚播下一片麦种，十分小心地守护着，因为有些秃鼻乌鸦和八哥不断地在耕地上找谷子吃。</seg>
<seg id="1519">Along with him went his Boy, carrying a sling:</seg>
<seg id="1519">农夫的儿子也跟着农夫一起来到田里，手上还拿着一把弹弓，</seg>
<seg id="1520">and whenever the Farmer asked for the sling the starlings understood what he said and warned the Rooks and they were off in a moment.</seg>
<seg id="1520">每当农夫要弹弓时，八哥都能听懂他的话，并警告秃鼻乌鸦赶快飞走。</seg>
<seg id="1521">So the Farmer hit on a trick.</seg>
<seg id="1521">因此，农夫想出一招。</seg>
<seg id="1522">"My lad," said he, "we must get the better of these birds somehow.</seg>
<seg id="1522">“我的孩子，”他说，“我们必须得打败这些鸟。</seg>
<seg id="1523">After this, when I want the sling, I won't say 'sling,' but just 'humph!' and you must then hand me the sling quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1523">以后，等我想要弹弓时，我不会再说弹弓了，而只是“哼”一声，而你必须赶快递给我弹弓。”</seg>
<seg id="1524">Presently back came the whole flock.</seg>
<seg id="1524">不久，鸟群又回来了。</seg>
<seg id="1525">"Humph!" said the Farmer;</seg>
<seg id="1525">“哼！”农夫说，</seg>
<seg id="1526">but the starlings took no notice, and he had time to sling several stones among them, hitting one on the head, another in the legs, and another in the wing, before they got out of range.</seg>
<seg id="1526">不过，这次八哥没注意到，所以农夫有时间弹了多次石头，还没等他们飞走，便击中了一只鸟的头，一只鸟的腿，另一只鸟的翅膀。</seg>
<seg id="1527">As they made all haste away they met some cranes, who asked them what the matter was.</seg>
<seg id="1527">乌鸦和八哥在逃跑的路上遇见了几只鹤，其中一只问他们出了什么事。</seg>
<seg id="1528">"Matter?" said one of the Rooks;</seg>
<seg id="1528">“出事？”一只秃鼻乌鸦喊道，</seg>
<seg id="1529">"it's those rascals, men, that are the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1529">“都是人类那些骗子，他们就是麻烦。</seg>
<seg id="1530">Don't you go near them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">你不要去靠近他们。</seg>
<seg id="1531">They have a way of saying one thing and meaning another which has just been the death of several of our poor friends."</seg>
<seg id="1531">他们嘴里说一套，做的却是另一套，我们几个可怜的朋友刚刚因此而丧命呢！”</seg>
<seg id="1532">THE ASS AND THE DOG</seg>
<seg id="1532">驴和狗</seg>
<seg id="1533">An Ass and a Dog were on their travels together, and, as they went along, they found a sealed packet lying on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1533">一头驴和一只狗一起外出旅行，走了一段路后，他们发现地上有一封密封好的信。</seg>
<seg id="1534">The Ass picked it up, broke the seal, and found it contained some writing, which he proceeded to read out aloud to the Dog.</seg>
<seg id="1534">驴捡起来，撕开封印，发现上面有写好的字，便大声读给狗听。</seg>
<seg id="1535">As he read on it turned out to be all about grass and barley and hay--in short, all the kinds of fodder that Asses are fond of.</seg>
<seg id="1535">可是，信里提到的几乎全是干草、大麦和糠麸之类驴喜欢的东西。</seg>
<seg id="1536">The Dog was a good deal bored with listening to all this, till at last his impatience got the better of him, and he cried, "Just skip a few pages, friend, and see if there isn't something about meat and bones."</seg>
<seg id="1536">听到这些内容，狗觉着很无聊，终于不耐烦地对驴喊道：“赶紧跳过这些内容，朋友，看看下面有没有提到肉和骨头之类的。”</seg>
<seg id="1537">The Ass glanced all through the packet, but found nothing of the sort, and said so.</seg>
<seg id="1537">驴浏览了一下信的全部内容，没有发现任何狗所想要的东西，就如实说了。</seg>
<seg id="1538">Then the Dog said in disgust, "Oh, throw it away, do: what's the good of a thing like that?"</seg>
<seg id="1538">然后，狗就带着厌恶的表情说：“把它扔了吧，朋友，这封信有什么意思呀？”</seg>
<seg id="1539">THE ASS CARRYING THE IMAGE</seg>
<seg id="1539">背着神像的驴</seg>
<seg id="1540">A certain man put an Image on the back of his Ass to take it to one of the temples of the town.</seg>
<seg id="1540">有个人把神像放在驴的背上，准备运到城里的一座寺庙里。</seg>
<seg id="1541">As they went along the road all the people they met uncovered and bowed their heads out of reverence for the Image;</seg>
<seg id="1541">他们走在路上时，所有遇见他们的人都对着神像顶礼膜拜，</seg>
<seg id="1542">but the Ass thought they were doing it out of respect for himself, and began to give himself airs accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="1542">而驴却以为人们是在向它致敬，逐渐骄傲自满起来。</seg>
<seg id="1543">At last he became so conceited that he imagined he could do as he liked, and, by way of protest against the load he was carrying, he came to a full stop and flatly declined to proceed any further.</seg>
<seg id="1543">最后，自以为是的他竟然幻想着可以肆意妄为，再也不用驮着沉重的货物了，于是，驴停下了脚步，再也不肯往前走。</seg>
<seg id="1544">His driver, finding him so obstinate, hit him hard and long with his stick, saying the while, "Oh, you dunder-headed idiot, do you suppose it's come to this, that men pay worship to an Ass?"</seg>
<seg id="1544">赶驴的人发现他这么固执，便用棍子狠狠地打了他一顿，并且说道：“你这个蠢货，竟然自以为这是在向你致敬，人们会对一头驴这么恭敬吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1545">Rude shocks await those who take to themselves the credit that is due to others.</seg>
<seg id="1545">那些夺走他人荣誉的人，必定会遭受沉重的打击。</seg>
<seg id="1546">THE ATHENIAN AND THE THEBAN</seg>
<seg id="1546">雅典人和底比斯人</seg>
<seg id="1547">An Athenian and a Theban were on the road together, and passed the time in conversation, as is the way of travellers.</seg>
<seg id="1547">一个雅典人和一个底比斯人一同走在路上，就像其他旅行者一样，他们用聊天来打发时间。</seg>
<seg id="1548">After discussing a variety of subjects they began to talk about heroes, a topic that tends to be more fertile than edifying.</seg>
<seg id="1548">聊了一些其他话题之后，他们开始谈起英雄，虽然没有什么教育意义，但这可是一个颇有谈资的内容。</seg>
<seg id="1549">Each of them was lavish in his praises of the heroes of his own city, until eventually the Theban asserted that Hercules was the greatest hero who had ever lived on earth, and now occupied a foremost place among the gods;</seg>
<seg id="1549">一提到赞美各自城市里的英雄，两个人都侃侃而谈。后来，底比斯人断言，赫拉克勒斯是地球上曾经存在过的最伟大的英雄，现在占据了众神之中的首要位置。</seg>
<seg id="1550">while the Athenian insisted that Theseus was far superior, for his fortune had been in every way supremely blessed, whereas Hercules had at one time been forced to act as a servant.</seg>
<seg id="1550">而雅典人则坚持认为，提修斯远远超过了赫拉克勒斯，因为他的命运在各方面都得到了充分的眷顾，而赫拉克勒斯曾一度被迫充当奴隶。</seg>
<seg id="1551">And he gained his point, for he was a very glib fellow, like all Athenians;</seg>
<seg id="1551">他达到了自己的目的，因为他像所有雅典人一样，是一个非常圆滑的家伙。</seg>
<seg id="1552">so that the Theban, who was no match for him in talking, cried at last in some disgust, "All right, have your way;</seg>
<seg id="1552">而底比斯人在谈话中根本不是他的对手，最后有些反感地大吼道：“好吧，随便你。</seg>
<seg id="1553">I only hope that, when our heroes are angry with us, Athens may suffer from the anger of Hercules, and Thebes only from that of Theseus."</seg>
<seg id="1553">我只希望，当我们的英雄对我们生气时，雅典人会从赫拉克勒斯的愤怒中遭殃，而底比斯人则从提修斯的愤怒中受苦。”</seg>
<seg id="1554">THE GOATHERD AND THE GOAT</seg>
<seg id="1554">牧羊人和山羊</seg>
<seg id="1555">A Goatherd was one day gathering his flock to return to the fold, when one of his goats strayed and refused to join the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1555">有一天，牧羊人赶着羊群回到羊圈里，其中有一只山羊失散了，并且拒绝回到羊群中。</seg>
<seg id="1556">He tried for a long time to get her to return by calling and whistling to her, but the Goat took no notice of him at all;</seg>
<seg id="1556">牧羊人费了好长时间叫她回来，既大声喊叫，又冲她吹口哨，但是山羊根本没注意到他。</seg>
<seg id="1557">so at last he threw a stone at her and broke one of her horns.</seg>
<seg id="1557">于是，牧羊人只得冲她扔了一块石头，正巧打断了山羊的一只羊角。</seg>
<seg id="1558">In dismay, he begged her not to tell his master: but she replied, "You silly fellow, my horn would cry aloud even if I held my tongue."</seg>
<seg id="1558">惊慌中，牧羊人肯求山羊不要告诉主人，可山羊却说：“你这个愚蠢的家伙，即使我不说，我的角也会告诉他事实呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1559">It's no use trying to hide what can't be hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1559">竭力掩盖无法隐瞒的事实是没用的。</seg>
<seg id="1560">THE SHEEP AND THE DOG</seg>
<seg id="1560">羊群和狗</seg>
<seg id="1561">Once upon a time the Sheep complained to the shepherd about the difference in his treatment of themselves and his Dog.</seg>
<seg id="1561">从前，有一群羊向牧羊人抱怨自己和狗受到了差别待遇。</seg>
<seg id="1562">"Your conduct," said they, "is very strange and, we think, very unfair.</seg>
<seg id="1562">“你的行为很奇怪，”羊群说，“我们认为非常不公平。</seg>
<seg id="1563">We provide you with wool and lambs and milk and you give us nothing but grass, and even that we have to find for ourselves:</seg>
<seg id="1563">我们为您提供羊毛、羔羊肉和羊奶，你却只给我们吃草，甚至于我们还要自己去找草吃。</seg>
<seg id="1564">but you get nothing at all from the Dog, and yet you feed him with tit-bits from your own table."</seg>
<seg id="1564">你从狗那里什么也没得到，可你却从自己的餐桌上拿些精美的食物喂他。”</seg>
<seg id="1565">Their remarks were overheard by the Dog, who spoke up at once and said, "Yes, and quite right, too:</seg>
<seg id="1565">狗听到了他们的言论，立刻开口说：“是的，的确如此。</seg>
<seg id="1566">where would you be if it wasn't for me?</seg>
<seg id="1566">要不是有我在，你们会在哪里呢？</seg>
<seg id="1567">Thieves would steal you!</seg>
<seg id="1567">小偷早就偷走你们了！</seg>
<seg id="1568">Wolves would eat you!</seg>
<seg id="1568">狼也会吃掉你们！</seg>
<seg id="1569">Indeed, if I didn't keep constant watch over you, you would be too terrified even to graze!"</seg>
<seg id="1569">其实，如果没有我守护着你们，你们可能连吃草都吓得不敢去！”</seg>
<seg id="1570">The Sheep were obliged to acknowledge that he spoke the truth, and never again made a grievance of the regard in which he was held by his master.</seg>
<seg id="1570">羊群不得不承认他说的有道理，便不再提受到主人差别待遇的意见了。</seg>
<seg id="1571">THE SHEPHERD AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1571">牧羊人和狼</seg>
<seg id="1572">A Shepherd found a Wolf's Cub straying in the pastures, and took him home and reared him along with his dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1572">牧羊人在牧场里捡到一只失散了的小狼崽，于是把它带回家，和狗一起喂养。</seg>
<seg id="1573">When the Cub grew to his full size, if ever a wolf stole a sheep from the flock, he used to join the dogs in hunting him down.</seg>
<seg id="1573">小狼崽长大以后，倘若有狼来偷羊吃，它就会和狗一起去追赶狼。</seg>
<seg id="1574">It sometimes happened that the dogs failed to come up with the thief, and, abandoning the pursuit, returned home.</seg>
<seg id="1574">有一次，狗没追上就回去了，</seg>
<seg id="1575">The Wolf would on such occasions continue the chase by himself, and when he overtook the culprit, would stop and share the feast with him, and then return to the Shepherd.</seg>
<seg id="1575">那只狼却继续追捕，待追上后，他看了看自己的同类，便与其一同分享了羊肉，然后回到牧羊人家里。</seg>
<seg id="1576">But if some time passed without a sheep being carried off by the wolves, he would steal one himself and share his plunder with the dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1576">从此以后，即便有时狼并没有来偷羊，他也会偷偷咬死一只羊，和狗一起分享战利品。</seg>
<seg id="1577">The Shepherd's suspicions were aroused, and one day he caught him in the act;</seg>
<seg id="1577">后来，牧羊人对它产生了怀疑，有一天终于发现了事实真相，</seg>
<seg id="1578">and, fastening a rope round his neck, hung him on the nearest tree.</seg>
<seg id="1578">便用绳子套住狼的脖子，将它吊死在旁边的树上。</seg>
<seg id="1579">What's bred in the bone is sure to come out in the flesh.</seg>
<seg id="1579">江山易改，本性难移。</seg>
<seg id="1580">THE LION, JUPITER, AND THE ELEPHANT</seg>
<seg id="1580">狮子、朱庇特和大象</seg>
<seg id="1581">The Lion, for all his size and strength, and his sharp teeth and claws, is a coward in one thing:</seg>
<seg id="1581">狮子有着健壮魁梧的体魄、锐利的牙齿和四爪，然而有一件事却让他成了懦夫。</seg>
<seg id="1582">he can't bear the sound of a cock crowing, and runs away whenever he hears it.</seg>
<seg id="1582">他受不了公鸡的啼鸣声。只要一听到这个声音，狮子立刻就会逃跑。</seg>
<seg id="1583">He complained bitterly to Jupiter for making him like that;</seg>
<seg id="1583">他痛苦地向朱庇特哭诉，为何把自己造成这样，</seg>
<seg id="1584">but Jupiter said it wasn't his fault:</seg>
<seg id="1584">可朱庇特却说这不是自己的错，</seg>
<seg id="1585">he had done the best he could for him, and, considering this was his only failing, he ought to be well content.</seg>
<seg id="1585">他已经尽可能地把优点都给了狮子，这不过是唯一的缺点，狮子应该知足了。</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Lion, however, wouldn't be comforted, and was so ashamed of his timidity that he wished he might die.</seg>
<seg id="1586">然而，狮子仍然觉着不舒服，为自己的胆小和懦弱羞愧得无地自容。</seg>
<seg id="1587">In this state of mind, he met the Elephant and had a talk with him.</seg>
<seg id="1587">正在这时候，他遇见了大象，便和大象聊起来。</seg>
<seg id="1588">He noticed that the great beast cocked up his ears all the time, as if he were listening for something, and he asked him why he did so.</seg>
<seg id="1588">他看见这头巨兽总是不停地扇动着耳朵，好像在倾听什么，于是便问为什么总这样。</seg>
<seg id="1589">Just then a gnat came humming by, and the Elephant said, "Do you see that wretched little buzzing insect?</seg>
<seg id="1589">恰好，有一只小飞虫在大象耳边嗡嗡地叫，大象回答说：“你看见这些嗡嗡叫的虫子了吗？</seg>
<seg id="1590">I'm terribly afraid of its getting into my ear:</seg>
<seg id="1590">我很担心他们钻进我的耳朵里，</seg>
<seg id="1591">if it once gets in, I'm dead and done for."</seg>
<seg id="1591">一旦让他们飞进去，我就完蛋了。”</seg>
<seg id="1592">The Lion's spirits rose at once when he heard this: "For," he said to himself, "if the Elephant, huge as he is, is afraid of a gnat, I needn't be so much ashamed of being afraid of a cock, who is ten thousand times bigger than a gnat."</seg>
<seg id="1592">一听到这话，狮子立刻打起了精神，自言自语地说：“如果像大象那么大的动物都害怕一只小虫子，我也不必为自己害怕公鸡而羞愧了，公鸡可比虫子大得多了。”</seg>
<seg id="1593">THE PIG AND THE SHEEP</seg>
<seg id="1593">猪和绵羊</seg>
<seg id="1594">A Pig found his way into a meadow where a flock of Sheep were grazing.</seg>
<seg id="1594">有一头猪跑进正在牧场里吃草的羊群中，</seg>
<seg id="1595">The shepherd caught him, and was proceeding to carry him off to the butcher's when he set up a loud squealing and struggled to get free.</seg>
<seg id="1595">牧羊人抓住了他，要把他送到屠夫那里，猪鬼哭狼嚎般拼命挣扎着想逃出来。</seg>
<seg id="1596">The Sheep rebuked him for making such a to-do, and said to him, "The shepherd catches us regularly and drags us off just like that, and we don't make any fuss."</seg>
<seg id="1596">羊群指责他大惊小怪，对猪说：“我们经常被牧羊人抓住，就像刚才那样被拖走，可从来不这样叫喊。”</seg>
<seg id="1597">"No, I dare say not," replied the Pig, "but my case and yours are altogether different:</seg>
<seg id="1597">猪回答说：“我和你们绝对不一样，</seg>
<seg id="1598">he only wants you for wool, but he wants me for bacon."</seg>
<seg id="1598">他抓你是为了你的毛，抓我却是为了吃我的肉呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1599">THE GARDENER AND HIS DOG</seg>
<seg id="1599">花匠和他的狗</seg>
<seg id="1600">A Gardner's Dog fell into a deep well, from which his master used to draw water for the plants in his garden with a rope and a bucket.</seg>
<seg id="1600">花匠的狗掉进了一口深井里，井旁边有绳子和桶，是花匠经常用来打水去浇花的工具，</seg>
<seg id="1601">Failing to get the Dog out by means of these, the Gardener went down into the well himself in order to fetch him up.</seg>
<seg id="1601">可无论用什么办法，他也没能把狗捞上来。于是，为了救小狗，花匠自己跳进了井中。</seg>
<seg id="1602">But the Dog thought he had come to make sure of drowning him;</seg>
<seg id="1602">可是，狗却以为主人下来是要淹死它。</seg>
<seg id="1603">so he bit his master as soon as he came within reach, and hurt him a good deal, with the result that he left the Dog to his fate and climbed out of the well, remarking, "It serves me quite right for trying to save so determined a suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1603">所以，当花匠靠近狗时，狗立刻狠狠地咬了他一口。花匠着实受了重伤，决定让狗自生自灭，不再管它了。花匠一边往上爬，一边说：“我真是活该！为什么要去救一个想要寻死的畜生呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1604">THE RIVERS AND THE SEA</seg>
<seg id="1604">河流和大海</seg>
<seg id="1605">Once upon a time all the Rivers combined to protest against the action of the Sea in making their waters salt.</seg>
<seg id="1605">从前，所有河流都联合起来抵抗大海的行为，不想让水变咸了。</seg>
<seg id="1606">"When we come to you," said they to the Sea, "we are sweet and drinkable:</seg>
<seg id="1606">“当我们流向你时，”河流对大海说，“我们本是甘甜可口的，</seg>
<seg id="1607">but when once we have mingled with you, our waters become as briny and unpalatable as your own."</seg>
<seg id="1607">可一旦与你混合，我们就变得跟你们一样，又咸又涩，一点儿都不好喝了。”</seg>
<seg id="1608">The Sea replied shortly, "Keep away from me and you'll remain sweet."</seg>
<seg id="1608">大海只是简单地回答道：“离我远一点，你们就会一直甘甜可口了。”</seg>
<seg id="1609">THE LION IN LOVE</seg>
<seg id="1609">恋爱的狮子</seg>
<seg id="1610">A Lion fell deeply in love with the daughter of a cottager and wanted to marry her;</seg>
<seg id="1610">一只狮子深深爱上了农夫的女儿，想娶她为妻。</seg>
<seg id="1611">but her father was unwilling to give her to so fearsome a husband, and yet didn't want to offend the Lion;</seg>
<seg id="1611">可是，农夫却不忍心让女儿嫁给一个这么可怕的丈夫，但又不想激怒狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1612">so he hit upon the following expedient.</seg>
<seg id="1612">于是他急中生智，想出一个权宜之计。</seg>
<seg id="1613">He went to the Lion and said, "I think you will make a very good husband for my daughter:</seg>
<seg id="1613">他去找狮子，并说：“我认为你是一个非常出色的丈夫人选，</seg>
<seg id="1614">but I cannot consent to your union unless you let me draw your teeth and pare your nails, for my daughter is terribly afraid of them."</seg>
<seg id="1614">但是我不能同意你们结合，除非先拔掉你的牙齿、剪掉你的指甲，因为我的女儿害怕这些东西。”</seg>
<seg id="1615">The Lion was so much in love that he readily agreed that this should be done.</seg>
<seg id="1615">狮子被爱冲昏了头，毫不犹豫地接受了农夫的要求。</seg>
<seg id="1616">When once, however, he was thus disarmed, the Cottager was afraid of him no longer, but drove him away with his club.</seg>
<seg id="1616">然而，狮子刚被缴械，农夫就不再惧怕狮子了，反而用棍棒赶走了狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1617">THE BEE-KEEPER</seg>
<seg id="1617">养蜂人</seg>
<seg id="1618">A Thief found his way into an apiary when the Bee-keeper was away, and stole all the honey.</seg>
<seg id="1618">趁养蜂人不在家时，一个小偷溜进蜂房，偷走了所有的蜂蜜。</seg>
<seg id="1619">When the Keeper returned and found the hives empty, he was very much upset and stood staring at them for some time.</seg>
<seg id="1619">养蜂人回来后发现蜂箱空了，伤心难过之余，他站在那里盯着看了很长时间。</seg>
<seg id="1620">Before long the bees came back from gathering honey, and, finding their hives overturned and the Keeper standing by, they made for him with their stings.</seg>
<seg id="1620">不久，蜜蜂采完花蜜回来，发现自己的蜂巢空了，而养蜂人又站在一边，便都围住他用尾针刺。</seg>
<seg id="1621">At this he fell into a passion and cried, "You ungrateful scoundrels, you let the thief who stole my honey get off scot-free, and then you go and sting me who have always taken such care of you!"</seg>
<seg id="1621">养蜂人被群蜂围住，痛苦地大喊：“你们这些不知感恩的坏家伙！让那偷蜜的贼逃之夭夭，却一个劲地来刺一直在照顾你们的人！”</seg>
<seg id="1622">When you hit back make sure you have got the right man.</seg>
<seg id="1622">发动反击时，一定要确定自己找对了人。</seg>
<seg id="1623">THE WOLF AND THE HORSE</seg>
<seg id="1623">狼和马</seg>
<seg id="1624">A Wolf on his rambles came to a field of oats, but, not being able to eat them, he was passing on his way when a Horse came along.</seg>
<seg id="1624">一只狼溜达着来到了一个麦田，然而，狼并不吃大麦，看见一匹马走过来，他便让开了。</seg>
<seg id="1625">"Look," said the Wolf, "here's a fine field of oats.</seg>
<seg id="1625">狼对马说：“看吧，这是一块上好的麦田。</seg>
<seg id="1626">For your sake I have left it untouched, and I shall greatly enjoy the sound of your teeth munching the ripe grain."</seg>
<seg id="1626">为了给你留着，我都没敢动。而且，我非常喜欢听你牙齿咀嚼成熟麦穗的声音。”</seg>
<seg id="1627">But the Horse replied, "If wolves could eat oats, my fine friend, you would hardly have indulged your ears at the cost of your belly."</seg>
<seg id="1627">然而，马却回答说：“朋友，如果狼能吃大麦，你就未必喜欢听我吃麦穗的声音了。”</seg>
<seg id="1628">There is no virtue in giving to others what is useless to oneself.</seg>
<seg id="1628">将己所不欲之物施与他人，并无美德可言。</seg>
<seg id="1629">THE BAT, THE BRAMBLE, AND THE SEAGULL</seg>
<seg id="1629">蝙蝠、荆棘和海鸥</seg>
<seg id="1630">A Bat, a Bramble, and a Seagull went into partnership and determined to go on a trading voyage together.</seg>
<seg id="1630">一只蝙蝠、一棵荆棘与一只海鸥，决定合伙出海做一次生意。</seg>
<seg id="1631">The Bat borrowed a sum of money for his venture; the Bramble laid in a stock of clothes of various kinds; and the Seagull took a quantity of lead:</seg>
<seg id="1631">于是，蝙蝠借了一笔钱作为资金，荆棘带来了一包款式不同的衣服，而海鸥带来了一些铅，</seg>
<seg id="1632">and so they set out.</seg>
<seg id="1632">然后，他们起航出发了。</seg>
<seg id="1633">By and by a great storm came on, and their boat with all the cargo went to the bottom, but the three travellers managed to reach land.</seg>
<seg id="1633">不久，一场暴风雨袭来，他们的船和所有货物都沉没了。幸运的是，三个航行者设法回到了岸上。</seg>
<seg id="1634">Ever since then the Seagull flies to and fro over the sea, and every now and then dives below the surface, looking for the lead he's lost;</seg>
<seg id="1634">从此以后，海鸥总是在海面上飞来飞去，即便偶尔钻入水中，也是在寻找丢失的铅；</seg>
<seg id="1635">while the Bat is so afraid of meeting his creditors that he hides away by day and only comes out at night to feed;</seg>
<seg id="1635">蝙蝠则害怕见到债主，所以总是白天藏着，夜里才出来觅食；</seg>
<seg id="1636">and the Bramble catches hold of the clothes of every one who passes by, hoping some day to recognise and recover the lost garments.</seg>
<seg id="1636">而荆棘总爱扯住过路人的衣服，希望有一天能找到丢失的衣服以弥补损失。</seg>
<seg id="1637">All men are more concerned to recover what they lose than to acquire what they lack.</seg>
<seg id="1637">所有人都更希望能弥补损失，而非弥补不足。</seg>
<seg id="1638">THE DOG AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1638">狗和狼</seg>
<seg id="1639">A Dog was lying in the sun before a farmyard gate when a Wolf pounced upon him and was just going to eat him up;</seg>
<seg id="1639">在阳光照耀下，一条狗躺在农院门前睡着了。一只狼窥见后，冲上去袭击他，正想吃掉他时，</seg>
<seg id="1640">but he begged for his life and said, "You see how thin I am and what a wretched meal I should make you now:</seg>
<seg id="1640">狗乞求狼饶了自己，说：“我现在骨瘦如柴，还不够你塞牙缝的呢。</seg>
<seg id="1641">but if you will only wait a few days my master is going to give a feast.</seg>
<seg id="1641">不过，如果你再多等几天，我的主人就要举办宴会了，</seg>
<seg id="1642">All the rich scraps and pickings will fall to me and I shall get nice and fat:</seg>
<seg id="1642">到时，所有的佳肴美食都会给我吃，而我也会变得肥肥胖胖的，</seg>
<seg id="1643">then will be the time for you to eat me."</seg>
<seg id="1643">然后，你再来吃我，不是更好吗。”</seg>
<seg id="1644">The Wolf thought this was a very good plan and went away.</seg>
<seg id="1644">狼听信了狗的话，便放了他。</seg>
<seg id="1645">Some time afterwards he came to the farmyard again, and found the Dog lying out of reach on the stable roof.</seg>
<seg id="1645">过了几天，狼又来到农院，发现狗躺在他够不到的屋顶上。</seg>
<seg id="1646">"Come down," he called, "and be eaten: you remember our agreement?"</seg>
<seg id="1646">“下来，”狼喊道，“快让我吃了你，你不记得我们的协议了吗？”</seg>
<seg id="1647">But the Dog said coolly, "My friend, if ever you catch me lying down by the gate there again, don't you wait for any feast."</seg>
<seg id="1647">而狗却从容地说：“朋友，要是你上次在门口抓住了躺在地上的我，就不用等待什么宴会了呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1648">Once bitten, twice shy.</seg>
<seg id="1648">一朝被蛇咬，十年怕井绳。</seg>
<seg id="1649">THE WASP AND THE SNAKE</seg>
<seg id="1649">黄蜂和蛇</seg>
<seg id="1650">A Wasp settled on the head of a Snake, and not only stung him several times, but clung obstinately to the head of his victim.</seg>
<seg id="1650">一只黄蜂坐在一条蛇的头上，不仅多次用刺去叮蛇，而且还牢牢地贴在受害者的头上。</seg>
<seg id="1651">Maddened with pain the Snake tried every means he could think of to get rid of the creature, but without success.</seg>
<seg id="1651">蛇疼得快要发疯了，尝试了很多方法想要赶走这个黄蜂，可是都没有成功。</seg>
<seg id="1652">At last he became desperate, and crying, "Kill you I will, even at the cost of my own life,"</seg>
<seg id="1652">最后，蛇绝望了，大喊道：“我要杀了你，即使丢掉我自己的性命也在所不惜。”</seg>
<seg id="1653">he laid his head with the Wasp on it under the wheel of a passing waggon, and they both perished together.</seg>
<seg id="1653">于是，蛇将自己的头伸到一辆从旁经过的马车车轮下，他们同归于尽了。</seg>
<seg id="1654">THE EAGLE AND THE BEETLE</seg>
<seg id="1654">老鹰和甲虫</seg>
<seg id="1655">An Eagle was chasing a hare, which was running for dear life and was at her wits' end to know where to turn for help.</seg>
<seg id="1655">一只鹰正在奋力追一只兔子，而兔子则拼命奔跑，一筹莫展地不知该到哪里寻求帮助。</seg>
<seg id="1656">Presently she espied a Beetle, and begged it to aid her.</seg>
<seg id="1656">这时，她恰巧看见一只甲虫，便向他求救。</seg>
<seg id="1657">So when the Eagle came up the Beetle warned her not to touch the hare, which was under its protection.</seg>
<seg id="1657">于是，当老鹰过来时，甲虫便警告她不要碰那只兔子。</seg>
<seg id="1658">But the Eagle never noticed the Beetle because it was so small, seized the hare and ate her up.</seg>
<seg id="1658">老鹰根本没有把小小的甲虫放在眼里，因为它实在太不起眼了，终于还是抓住兔子并吃了她。</seg>
<seg id="1659">The Beetle never forgot this, and used to keep an eye on the Eagle's nest, and whenever the Eagle laid an egg it climbed up and rolled it out of the nest and broke it.</seg>
<seg id="1659">甲虫一直没有忘记这件事，经常关注着老鹰的巢，只要老鹰一下蛋，他便悄悄地爬上去，把老鹰蛋滚出巢来摔碎它。</seg>
<seg id="1660">At last the Eagle got so worried over the loss of her eggs that she went up to Jupiter, who is the special protector of Eagles, and begged him to give her a safe place to nest in:</seg>
<seg id="1660">后来，老鹰十分担心再丢失自己的蛋，便跑到朱庇特（鹰的特别守护神）那里，请求给自己一个安全的地方生儿育女。</seg>
<seg id="1661">so he let her lay her eggs in his lap.</seg>
<seg id="1661">于是，朱庇特让她在自己的膝上下蛋。</seg>
<seg id="1662">But the Beetle noticed this and made a ball of dirt the size of an Eagle's egg, and flew up and deposited it in Jupiter's lap.</seg>
<seg id="1662">然而，甲虫也注意到了此事，就做了一个和鹰蛋差不多大小的泥球，然后飞上去，把它扔到了朱庇特的膝盖上。</seg>
<seg id="1663">When Jupiter saw the dirt, he stood up to shake it out of his robe, and, forgetting about the eggs, he shook them out too, and they were broken just as before.</seg>
<seg id="1663">朱庇特一看是泥球，马上站起身来抖擞自己的长袍，浑然忘记了膝上还有老鹰下的蛋，无意间把蛋也抖落了，老鹰的蛋像之前那样摔了个粉碎。</seg>
<seg id="1664">Ever since then, they say, Eagles never lay their eggs at the season when Beetles are about.</seg>
<seg id="1664">据说，从那以后，在甲虫出现的时节，老鹰就再也不下蛋了。</seg>
<seg id="1665">The weak will sometimes find ways to avenge an insult, even upon the strong.</seg>
<seg id="1665">即便对手是强者，弱者有时也会想方设法地报仇雪耻。</seg>
<seg id="1666">THE FOWLER AND THE LARK</seg>
<seg id="1666">捕鸟人和百灵鸟</seg>
<seg id="1667">A Fowler was setting his nets for little birds when a Lark came up to him and asked him what he was doing.</seg>
<seg id="1667">一个捕鸟人正在撒网，好让小鸟们自投罗网。这时，一只百灵鸟走过来，问他在干什么。</seg>
<seg id="1668">"I am engaged in founding a city," said he, and with that he withdrew to a short distance and concealed himself.</seg>
<seg id="1668">“我正在建造一座漂亮的城市。”捕鸟人回答道，说完就跑到远处藏起来。</seg>
<seg id="1669">The Lark examined the nets with great curiosity, and presently, catching sight of the bait, hopped on to them in order to secure it, and became entangled in the meshes.</seg>
<seg id="1669">百灵鸟带着极大的好奇心，跑过去想看个究竟，她小心地冲着网中的诱饵跳过去，结果却被缠在网中。</seg>
<seg id="1670">The Fowler then ran up quickly and captured her.</seg>
<seg id="1670">捕鸟人很快跑过来，抓住了她。</seg>
<seg id="1671">"What a fool I was!" said she:</seg>
<seg id="1671">百灵鸟说：“我可真是个傻瓜！</seg>
<seg id="1672">"but at any rate, if that's the kind of city you are founding, it'll be a long time before you find fools enough to fill it."</seg>
<seg id="1672">但无论如何，如果这就是你建造的城市，那么估计要花很长时间才能找到足够多的傻瓜来填补空缺！”</seg>
<seg id="1673">THE FISHERMAN PIPING</seg>
<seg id="1673">吹笛子的渔夫</seg>
<seg id="1674">A Fisherman who could play the flute went down one day to the sea-shore with his nets and his flute;</seg>
<seg id="1674">有一天，一个会吹长笛的渔夫带着笛子和渔网来到海边，</seg>
<seg id="1675">and, taking his stand on a projecting rock, began to play a tune, thinking that the music would bring the fish jumping out of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1675">他站在一块突出海面的岩石上，开始吹奏曲子，希望用笛声引诱鱼儿跳出海面。</seg>
<seg id="1676">He went on playing for some time, but not a fish appeared:</seg>
<seg id="1676">渔夫弹奏了一会儿，没有一条鱼出来。</seg>
<seg id="1677">so at last he threw down his flute and cast his net into the sea, and made a great haul of fish.</seg>
<seg id="1677">最后，他把长笛放到一边，撒网入海，却捞起满网的鱼。</seg>
<seg id="1678">When they were landed and he saw them leaping about on the shore, he cried, "You rascals!</seg>
<seg id="1678">当渔夫把网拖上岸后，看见鱼儿在岸边不停地跳跃，他便说：“你们这些淘气鬼！</seg>
<seg id="1679">you wouldn't dance when I piped:</seg>
<seg id="1679">我吹笛子时，你们不肯跳；</seg>
<seg id="1680">but now I've stopped, you can do nothing else!"</seg>
<seg id="1680">现在我不吹了，你们却在这里欢蹦乱跳！”</seg>
<seg id="1681">THE WEASEL AND THE MAN</seg>
<seg id="1681">黄鼠狼和人</seg>
<seg id="1682">A Man once caught a Weasel, which was always sneaking about the house, and was just going to drown it in a tub of water, when it begged hard for its life, and said to him, "Surely you haven't the heart to put me to death?</seg>
<seg id="1682">从前，有一个人抓住了一只黄鼠狼，它总是在房子里偷偷摸摸。这人正要用一盆水淹死它时，黄鼠狼苦苦哀求人饶了自己的性命，并且对人说：“你一定不忍心杀了我！</seg>
<seg id="1683">Think how useful I have been in clearing your house of the mice and lizards which used to infest it, and show your gratitude by sparing my life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">想想我对你们家做的贡献吧，我可是一直在清理你家里的老鼠和蜥蜴，为了显示你对我的感激之情，就饶我一命吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1684">"You have not been altogether useless, I grant you," said the Man:</seg>
<seg id="1684">“我也承认，你并非完全无用，”男人说，</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but who killed the fowls?</seg>
<seg id="1685">“但是，是谁杀了鸡？</seg>
<seg id="1686">Who stole the meat?</seg>
<seg id="1686">是谁偷了肉？</seg>
<seg id="1687">No, no!</seg>
<seg id="1687">不，不！</seg>
<seg id="1688">You do much more harm than good, and die you shall."</seg>
<seg id="1688">你做了太多坏事，理应去死。”</seg>
<seg id="1689">THE PLOUGHMAN, THE ASS, AND THE OX</seg>
<seg id="1689">农夫、驴和公牛</seg>
<seg id="1690">A Ploughman yoked his Ox and his Ass together, and set to work to plough his field.</seg>
<seg id="1690">农夫给他的公牛和驴一起套上牛轭，然后赶着它们下地犁田。</seg>
<seg id="1691">It was a poor makeshift of a team, but it was the best he could do, as he had but a single Ox.</seg>
<seg id="1691">这是一个糟糕的临时组合，但农夫已经尽力了，因为他只有一头公牛。</seg>
<seg id="1692">At the end of the day, when the beasts were loosed from the yoke, the Ass said to the Ox, "Well, we've had a hard day: which of us is to carry the master home?"</seg>
<seg id="1692">干了一天活后，牲口被主人从牛轭里解放出来，驴对牛说：“我们可是度过了艰难的一天，我们两个当中，谁载着主人回家呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1693">The Ox looked surprised at the question. "Why," said he, "you, to be sure, as usual."</seg>
<seg id="1693">听了驴的话，牛似乎很惊讶，“怎么这么问呢，”他说，“当然是你，像往常一样。”</seg>
<seg id="1694">DEMADES AND HIS FABLE</seg>
<seg id="1694">狄马德斯和他的寓言</seg>
<seg id="1695">Demades the orator was once speaking in the Assembly at Athens;</seg>
<seg id="1695">有一次，演说家狄马德斯在雅典的一次集会上演讲，</seg>
<seg id="1696">but the people were very inattentive to what he was saying, so he stopped and said, "Gentlemen, I should like to tell you one of Æsop's fables."</seg>
<seg id="1696">但是没有一个人认真听，他便停下来，说：“先生们，我很想告诉你们一个伊索寓言里的故事。”</seg>
<seg id="1697">This made every one listen intently.</seg>
<seg id="1697">这话受到了人们的重视。</seg>
<seg id="1698">Then Demades began: "Demeter, a Swallow, and an Eel were once travelling together, and came to a river without a bridge:</seg>
<seg id="1698">接着，他开始说：“有一次，得墨忒耳（掌管农业、结婚、丰饶的女神）和一只燕子、一条鳗鱼一同出行，他们要穿过一条没有桥的河，</seg>
<seg id="1699">the Swallow flew over it, and the Eel swam across";</seg>
<seg id="1699">燕子飞过去了，鳗鱼游过去了。”</seg>
<seg id="1700">and then he stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1700">讲到这里，他便停下来，不再讲了。</seg>
<seg id="1701">"What happened to Demeter?" cried several people in the audience.</seg>
<seg id="1701">听众中有几个人问他：“那么得墨忒耳怎么过去的呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1702">"Demeter," he replied, "is very angry with you for listening to fables when you ought to be minding public business."</seg>
<seg id="1702">他回答说：“得墨忒耳正在生你们的气呢，因为你们对公共事务毫无兴趣，一心只喜欢听伊索寓言。”</seg>
<seg id="1703">THE MONKEY AND THE DOLPHIN</seg>
<seg id="1703">猴子和海豚</seg>
<seg id="1704">When people go on a voyage they often take with them lap-dogs or monkeys as pets to wile away the time.</seg>
<seg id="1704">人类在出海航行时喜欢带上哈巴狗或猴子之类的宠物，以供消遣。</seg>
<seg id="1705">Thus it fell out that a man returning to Athens from the East had a pet Monkey on board with him.</seg>
<seg id="1705">一个人从东方回到雅典时，就带了一只猴子随行。</seg>
<seg id="1706">As they neared the coast of Attica a great storm burst upon them, and the ship capsized.</seg>
<seg id="1706">当他们靠近阿提卡海岸时，一场风暴突然袭来，船被狂风巨浪打翻了，</seg>
<seg id="1707">All on board were thrown into the water, and tried to save themselves by swimming, the Monkey among the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1707">甲板上的所有人都被抛入水中，人们试着游向岸边，猴子也在其中。</seg>
<seg id="1708">A Dolphin saw him, and, supposing him to be a man, took him on his back and began swimming towards the shore.</seg>
<seg id="1708">一只海豚看见了猴子，以为是人，立即将它驮到背上，游向岸边。</seg>
<seg id="1709">When they got near the Piræus, which is the port of Athens, the Dolphin asked the Monkey if he was an Athenian.</seg>
<seg id="1709">当他们快要到达雅典的珀赖欧斯海港时，海豚问那猴子是不是雅典人。</seg>
<seg id="1710">The Monkey replied that he was, and added that he came of a very distinguished family.</seg>
<seg id="1710">猴子回答说是的，而且还补充说自己出身名门望族。</seg>
<seg id="1711">"Then, of course, you know the Piræus," continued the Dolphin.</seg>
<seg id="1711">“那么，你肯定了解珀赖欧斯了？”海琢接着又问道。</seg>
<seg id="1712">The Monkey thought he was referring to some high official or other, and replied, "Oh, yes, he's a very old friend of mine."</seg>
<seg id="1712">猴子以为海豚说的是某个官员或什么人，便回答说：“他是我的一个老朋友。”</seg>
<seg id="1713">At that, detecting his hypocrisy, the Dolphin was so disgusted that he dived below the surface, and the unfortunate Monkey was quickly drowned.</seg>
<seg id="1713">海豚察觉到了猴子的虚伪，十分气愤，便没入水中，不幸的猴子很快就被淹死了。</seg>
<seg id="1714">THE CROW AND THE SNAKE</seg>
<seg id="1714">乌鸦和蛇</seg>
<seg id="1715">A hungry Crow spied a Snake lying asleep in a sunny spot, and, picking it up in his claws, he was carrying it off to a place where he could make a meal of it without being disturbed, when the Snake reared its head and bit him.</seg>
<seg id="1715">一只饥饿的乌鸦暗中发现一条蛇正在温暖的阳光下熟睡，便猛扑过去用爪子抓住了蛇，带着他飞到一个可以安然享受美食而不受打扰的地方，这时，惊醒的蛇回过头来，咬了乌鸦一大口。</seg>
<seg id="1716">It was a poisonous Snake, and the bite was fatal, and the dying Crow said, "What a cruel fate is mine!</seg>
<seg id="1716">这是一条毒蛇，挨咬的乌鸦受到了致命袭击。将死时，乌鸦说：“我的命运多么不幸呀！</seg>
<seg id="1717">I thought I had made a lucky find, and it has cost me my life!"</seg>
<seg id="1717">我以为自己找到了美食，可是却因此而丢掉了性命。”</seg>
<seg id="1718">THE DOGS AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1718">狗和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1719">Some Dogs once found a lion's skin, and were worrying it with their teeth.</seg>
<seg id="1719">几条狗发现了一张狮子皮，便使劲用牙齿撕碎了。</seg>
<seg id="1720">Just then a Fox came by, and said, "You think yourselves very brave, no doubt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">碰巧，一只狐狸走过来，说：“显然，你们以为自己很英勇，</seg>
<seg id="1721">but if that were a live lion you'd find his claws a good deal sharper than your teeth."</seg>
<seg id="1721">可如果这是一头活着的狮子，你们就会明白，他的爪子显然要比你们的牙齿更锋利。”</seg>
<seg id="1722">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE HAWK</seg>
<seg id="1722">夜莺和老鹰</seg>
<seg id="1723">A Nightingale was sitting on a bough of an oak and singing, as her custom was.</seg>
<seg id="1723">夜莺坐在一棵橡树的树枝上，像往常一样在歌唱。</seg>
<seg id="1724">A hungry Hawk presently spied her, and darting to the spot seized her in his talons.</seg>
<seg id="1724">一只饥饿的老鹰看见她后，便猛飞过去用鹰爪抓住了她。</seg>
<seg id="1725">He was just about to tear her in pieces when she begged him to spare her life:</seg>
<seg id="1725">就在老鹰将要撕碎夜莺时，她恳求老鹰饶命：</seg>
<seg id="1726">"I'm not big enough," she pleaded, "to make you a good meal:</seg>
<seg id="1726">“我的个头太小了，不能让你饱餐一顿，</seg>
<seg id="1727">you ought to seek your prey among the bigger birds."</seg>
<seg id="1727">你应当去抓那些个头更大的鸟。”</seg>
<seg id="1728">The Hawk eyed her with some contempt. "You must think me very simple," said he, "if you suppose I am going to give up a certain prize on the chance of a better of which I see at present no signs."</seg>
<seg id="1728">老鹰不屑一顾地看着她，说：“如果你认为我会放弃手中现成的食物，而去追求目前看不见影的东西，那可真是太小看我了。”</seg>
<seg id="1729">THE ROSE AND THE AMARANTH</seg>
<seg id="1729">玫瑰花和苋菜</seg>
<seg id="1730">A Rose and an Amaranth blossomed side by side in a garden, and the Amaranth said to her neighbour, "How I envy you your beauty and your sweet scent!</seg>
<seg id="1730">玫瑰花和苋菜在花园里并排而立，苋菜对自己的邻居——玫瑰花说：“我真羡慕你，有着漂亮的颜色和芬芳的香味！</seg>
<seg id="1731">No wonder you are such a universal favourite."</seg>
<seg id="1731">毫无疑问，你是世上最美丽的花朵！”</seg>
<seg id="1732">But the Rose replied with a shade of sadness in her voice, "Ah, my dear friend, I bloom but for a time:</seg>
<seg id="1732">玫瑰花却回答说：“亲爱的朋友，我只开一季而已。</seg>
<seg id="1733">my petals soon wither and fall, and then I die.</seg>
<seg id="1733">我的花瓣很快就会枯萎凋谢，然后我就死去了。</seg>
<seg id="1734">But your flowers never fade, even if they are cut; for they are everlasting."</seg>
<seg id="1734">而你的花却永不褪色，即使被割断了，它们依然能够常绿、不褪色。”</seg>
<seg id="1735">THE MAN, THE HORSE, THE OX, AND THE DOG</seg>
<seg id="1735">人、马、牛、狗</seg>
<seg id="1736">One winter's day, during a severe storm, a Horse, an Ox, and a Dog came and begged for shelter in the house of a Man.</seg>
<seg id="1736">冬日里的一天，一场强烈风暴过后，马、牛、狗纷纷来到人居住的房子里，乞求得到庇护。</seg>
<seg id="1737">He readily admitted them, and, as they were cold and wet, he lit a fire for their comfort:</seg>
<seg id="1737">人爽快地接纳了他们。因为他们又湿又冷，人便生火取暖，让他们舒服一些。</seg>
<seg id="1738">and he put oats before the Horse, and hay before the Ox, while he fed the Dog with the remains of his own dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1738">不仅如此，人还把燕麦放到马的面前，把干草放到牛的面前，把自己吃剩的饭放在狗的面前。</seg>
<seg id="1739">When the storm abated, and they were about to depart, they determined to show their gratitude in the following way.</seg>
<seg id="1739">风暴减弱后，他们准备离开人的房子，决定以某种方式来表示自己的感激之情。</seg>
<seg id="1740">They divided the life of Man among them, and each endowed one part of it with the qualities which were peculiarly his own.</seg>
<seg id="1740">他们将人的一生分成几个阶段，然后在每个阶段分别赋予自己的某种特殊品质。</seg>
<seg id="1741">The Horse took youth, and hence young men are high-mettled and impatient of restraint;</seg>
<seg id="1741">马取走了年轻阶段，因此，年轻人奋发向上但不受约束；</seg>
<seg id="1742">the Ox took middle age, and accordingly men in middle life are steady and hard-working;</seg>
<seg id="1742">牛取走了中年阶段，因此，中年人踏实稳定且埋头苦干；</seg>
<seg id="1743">while the Dog took old age, which is the reason why old men are so often peevish and ill-tempered, and, like dogs, attached chiefly to those who look to their comfort, while they are disposed to snap at those who are unfamiliar or distasteful to them.</seg>
<seg id="1743">而狗则接受了老年阶段，这正是老年人经常脾气暴躁的原因之一，他们也像狗那样，主要依赖那些能给他们带来温暖和舒适的人，而厉声呵斥那些陌生或令其不悦的人。</seg>
<seg id="1744">THE WOLVES, THE SHEEP, AND THE RAM</seg>
<seg id="1744">狼群、羊群和公羊</seg>
<seg id="1745">The Wolves sent a deputation to the Sheep with proposals for a lasting peace between them, on condition of their giving up the sheep-dogs to instant death.</seg>
<seg id="1745">狼群派了一个使者到羊群那里去送一份缔结永久和平的建议书，其中提出，只要羊群放弃牧羊犬的看护，并把他处死，狼群便愿意与羊群和平相处。</seg>
<seg id="1746">The foolish Sheep agreed to the terms;</seg>
<seg id="1746">愚蠢的羊群同意了狼群的提议，</seg>
<seg id="1747">but an old Ram, whose years had brought him wisdom, interfered and said, "How can we expect to live at peace with you?</seg>
<seg id="1747">但是一只上了年纪的公羊因年长而颇具智慧，他说：“即便眼前有狗在保护我们，我们尚且不能平安地逃出你们的魔爪，</seg>
<seg id="1748">Why, even with the dogs at hand to protect us, we are never secure from your murderous attacks!"</seg>
<seg id="1748">还怎么敢期望着与你们和平相处呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1749">THE SWAN</seg>
<seg id="1749">天鹅</seg>
<seg id="1750">The Swan is said to sing but once in its life--when it knows that it is about to die.</seg>
<seg id="1750">据说，天鹅一生只唱一次歌，只有在他死期临近时才唱。</seg>
<seg id="1751">A certain man, who had heard of the song of the Swan, one day saw one of these birds for sale in the market, and bought it and took it home with him.</seg>
<seg id="1751">一个曾经听过天鹅那优美歌声的人，偶然在市场上看到几只天鹅正待出售，便买了一只带回家。</seg>
<seg id="1752">A few days later he had some friends to dinner, and produced the Swan, and bade it sing for their entertainment: but the Swan remained silent.</seg>
<seg id="1752">几天后，他邀请了几个朋友来吃饭，并介绍了自己的天鹅，让他唱首歌来助兴。可是，天鹅却始终保持沉默。</seg>
<seg id="1753">In course of time, when it was growing old, it became aware of its approaching end and broke into a sweet, sad song.</seg>
<seg id="1753">后来，终于有一天，天鹅慢慢老了，他知道自己死期将至，便展开歌喉，唱出了一曲甜美哀婉的歌。</seg>
<seg id="1754">When its owner heard it, he said angrily, "If the creature only sings when it is about to die, what a fool I was that day I wanted to hear its song!</seg>
<seg id="1754">主人听到后，生气地说：“如果你真是在临死前才肯唱歌，那我多么愚蠢呀！</seg>
<seg id="1755">I ought to have wrung its neck instead of merely inviting it to sing."</seg>
<seg id="1755">我真应该在那天就拧断你的脖子，而不仅仅是让你唱歌了。”</seg>
<seg id="1756">THE SNAKE AND JUPITER</seg>
<seg id="1756">蛇和朱庇特</seg>
<seg id="1757">A Snake suffered a good deal from being constantly trodden upon by man and beast, owing partly to the length of his body and partly to his being unable to raise himself above the surface of the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1757">一条蛇因为人类和其他野兽的践踏常常生活在水深火热之中，部分原因是他的身体过长，另一部分原因是他无法离开地面。</seg>
<seg id="1758">so he went and complained to Jupiter about the risks to which he was exposed.</seg>
<seg id="1758">于是，他便跑去向朱庇特抱怨自己所暴露出的危险。</seg>
<seg id="1759">But Jupiter had little sympathy for him.</seg>
<seg id="1759">可是，朱庇特却不怎么同情他。</seg>
<seg id="1760">"I dare say," said he, "that if you had bitten the first that trod on you, the others would have taken more trouble to look where they put their feet."</seg>
<seg id="1760">朱庇特说：“如果你咬了第一个践踏你的人，其他人就不再敢冒险这样做了。”</seg>
<seg id="1761">THE WOLF AND HIS SHADOW</seg>
<seg id="1761">狼和他的影子</seg>
<seg id="1762">A Wolf, who was roaming about on the plain when the sun was getting low in the sky, was much impressed by the size of his shadow, and said to himself, "I had no idea I was so big.</seg>
<seg id="1762">一只狼在日落时漫步于平原上，看到自己的影子那么长，他得意洋洋地自言自语道：“我还不知道自己的身体居然有这么大。</seg>
<seg id="1763">Fancy my being afraid of a lion!</seg>
<seg id="1763">难以想象我竟然还怕一只狮子！</seg>
<seg id="1764">Why, I, not he, ought to be King of the beasts";</seg>
<seg id="1764">不，我不应该害怕他，我应该做百兽之王。”</seg>
<seg id="1765">and, heedless of danger, he strutted about as if there could be no doubt at all about it.</seg>
<seg id="1765">他沉醉于其中，忽视了身边的危险。</seg>
<seg id="1766">Just then a lion sprang upon him and began to devour him.</seg>
<seg id="1766">这时，一只狮子向他扑来，开始撕咬他。</seg>
<seg id="1767">"Alas," he cried, "had I not lost sight of the facts, I shouldn't have been ruined by my fancies."</seg>
<seg id="1767">“哎呀！”狼大声喊道，“若不是沉醉于虚幻之中，我就不会被自己的幻想毁了呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1768">THE PLOUGHMAN AND THE WOLF</seg>
<seg id="1768">农夫和狼</seg>
<seg id="1769">A Ploughman loosed his oxen from the plough, and led them away to the water to drink.</seg>
<seg id="1769">农夫松开牛脖子上挂着的牛轭，牵着它们到水边去喝水。</seg>
<seg id="1770">While he was absent a half-starved Wolf appeared on the scene, and went up to the plough and began chewing the leather straps attached to the yoke.</seg>
<seg id="1770">这时，一只饿得半死的狼出现了，他走到犁旁边，开始咀嚼牛轭上的皮套。</seg>
<seg id="1771">As he gnawed away desperately in the hope of satisfying his craving for food, he somehow got entangled in the harness, and, taking fright, struggled to get free, tugging at the traces as if he would drag the plough along with him.</seg>
<seg id="1771">为了能够填饱肚子，狼拼命地啃那皮套，不知不觉就将头伸进了牛轭中，惊慌中的狼拼命挣扎着想重获自由，结果只好拉着犁跑，就像要去田里耕地似的。</seg>
<seg id="1772">Just then the Ploughman came back, and seeing what was happening, he cried, "Ah, you old rascal, I wish you would give up thieving for good and take to honest work instead."</seg>
<seg id="1772">恰巧农夫回来了，看到眼前发生的一切，便说：“啊，你这个可恶的东西，但愿你弃恶从善，干点正经事。”</seg>
<seg id="1773">MERCURY AND THE MAN BITTEN BY AN ANT</seg>
<seg id="1773">墨丘利和被蚂蚁所咬的人</seg>
<seg id="1774">A Man once saw a ship go down with all its crew, and commented severely on the injustice of the gods.</seg>
<seg id="1774">一个人在海边看见一艘船遇难，船上的人全都被淹死了，他便愤愤不平地抱怨上帝。</seg>
<seg id="1775">"They care nothing for a man's character," said he, "but let the good and the bad go to their deaths together."</seg>
<seg id="1775">“唉，上帝都不考虑一个人的品格，”他说，“竟然让好人和坏人一起死了。”</seg>
<seg id="1776">There was an ant-heap close by where he was standing, and, just as he spoke, he was bitten in the foot by an Ant.</seg>
<seg id="1776">这个人当时正站在一个蚂蚁窝旁，当他说这番话时，被爬到脚上的一只蚂蚁咬了一口。</seg>
<seg id="1777">Turning in a temper to the ant-heap he stamped upon it and crushed hundreds of unoffending ants.</seg>
<seg id="1777">他立刻冲着身旁的蚂蚁窝撒起火来，碾死了许多并没有伤害他的蚂蚁。</seg>
<seg id="1778">Suddenly Mercury appeared, and belaboured him with his staff, saying as he did so, "You villain, where's your nice sense of justice now?"</seg>
<seg id="1778">这时，墨丘利出现了，用棍棒痛打了他一顿，而且还重复着那人刚才所说的话：“你这个恶棍，现在你的正义感又去哪里了呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1779">THE WILY LION</seg>
<seg id="1779">狡猾的狮子</seg>
<seg id="1780">A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns.</seg>
<seg id="1780">一只狮子看见一头肥壮的公牛正在吃草，一想到这是一顿美味佳肴，口水禁不住就流了出来，可是他又畏惧公牛的尖角，不敢轻易发起进攻。</seg>
<seg id="1781">Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something:</seg>
<seg id="1781">然而，饥饿促使他一定要做点什么。</seg>
<seg id="1782">and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.</seg>
<seg id="1782">单凭武力，他肯定无法成功，于是狮子决定用诡计智取。</seg>
<seg id="1783">Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, "I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure.</seg>
<seg id="1783">他带着友好的姿态走到公牛身旁，对公牛说：“简直无法用语言来表达我对您那魔鬼般的身材有多羡慕，</seg>
<seg id="1784">What a fine head!</seg>
<seg id="1784">这是多么漂亮的头呀，</seg>
<seg id="1785">What powerful shoulders and thighs!</seg>
<seg id="1785">多么宽阔结实的肩膀和大腿呀！</seg>
<seg id="1786">But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns?</seg>
<seg id="1786">不过，亲爱的朋友，究竟是什么让你戴着这两只奇丑无比的角呢？</seg>
<seg id="1787">You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly.</seg>
<seg id="1787">你一定也发现了，它们又笨拙又丑陋。</seg>
<seg id="1788">Believe me, you would do much better without them."</seg>
<seg id="1788">相信我，若是没有了这两只角，你肯定会更好。”</seg>
<seg id="1789">The Bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off;</seg>
<seg id="1789">公牛也够蠢的，竟然被这番恭维所说服，把自己的两只角折断了，</seg>
<seg id="1790">and, having now lost his only means of defence, fell an easy prey to the Lion.</seg>
<seg id="1790">刚刚失去用以防卫的武器，公牛就轻易地被狮子虏获了。</seg>

<seg id="1791">鹦鹉和猫</seg>
<seg id="1792">A Man once bought a Parrot and gave it the run of his house.</seg>
<seg id="1792">从前，有个人买了一只鹦鹉，让它在房子里自由自在地生活。</seg>
<seg id="1793">It revelled in its liberty, and presently flew up on to the mantelpiece and screamed away to its heart's content.</seg>
<seg id="1793">这只鹦鹉欣喜若狂，高兴地飞上了壁炉架，尽情地叫着。</seg>
<seg id="1794">The noise disturbed the Cat, who was asleep on the hearthrug.</seg>
<seg id="1794">一只猫正在壁炉前的地毯上睡觉，鹦鹉的吵闹声惊扰了她。</seg>
<seg id="1795">Looking up at the intruder, she said, "Who may you be, and where have you come from?"</seg>
<seg id="1795">看着这个刚来的入侵者，猫问道：“你是谁，从哪里来的？”</seg>
<seg id="1796">The Parrot replied, "Your master has just bought me and brought me home with him."</seg>
<seg id="1796">鹦鹉回答道：“你的主人刚刚买了我，带我来到这个房子里。”</seg>
<seg id="1797">"You impudent bird," said the Cat, "how dare you, a newcomer, make a noise like that?</seg>
<seg id="1797">“你这个放肆无礼的家伙，”猫说，“怎么刚到这里就这么吵闹呢？</seg>
<seg id="1798">Why, I was born here, and have lived here all my life, and yet, if I venture to mew, they throw things at me and chase me all over the place."</seg>
<seg id="1798">我可是在这里出生的，而且一直住在这个家里。但即便如此，如果我冒险喵喵地叫几声，主人就会朝我扔东西，到处追着赶我出去。”</seg>
<seg id="1799">"Look here, mistress," said the Parrot, "you just hold your tongue.</seg>
<seg id="1799">鹦鹉回答说：“喂，你最好赶快闭上嘴。</seg>
<seg id="1800">My voice they delight in; but yours--yours is a perfect nuisance."</seg>
<seg id="1800">我的声音多么悦耳动听呀，他们可都喜欢；而你的叫声，实在是一种噪音。”</seg>
<seg id="1801">THE STAG AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1801">雄鹿和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1802">A Stag was chased by the hounds, and took refuge in a cave, where he hoped to be safe from his pursuers.</seg>
<seg id="1802">有只鹿受到了猎犬的追捕，拼命地逃进一个洞里寻求庇护。他希望这是一个安全的地方，可以躲避猎犬。</seg>
<seg id="1803">Unfortunately the cave contained a Lion, to whom he fell an easy prey.</seg>
<seg id="1803">不幸的是，这个洞里有一只狮子，轻易地就抓获了鹿。</seg>
<seg id="1804">"Unhappy that I am," he cried, "I am saved from the power of the dogs only to fall into the clutches of a Lion."</seg>
<seg id="1804">鹿临死之前说：“我真是倒霉，刚脱离了猎犬的追捕，马上又掉进了狮子的大口。”</seg>
<seg id="1805">Out of the frying-pan into the fire.</seg>
<seg id="1805">刚从油锅里出来，又掉进了火坑。</seg>
<seg id="1806">THE IMPOSTOR</seg>
<seg id="1806">说谎的人</seg>
<seg id="1807">A certain man fell ill, and, being in a very bad way, he made a vow that he would sacrifice a hundred oxen to the gods if they would grant him a return to health.</seg>
<seg id="1807">有个人生了病，状况非常严重，他向众神发誓，如果能恢复健康，他一定会供奉一百头牛给众神。</seg>
<seg id="1808">Wishing to see how he would keep his vow, they caused him to recover in a short time.</seg>
<seg id="1808">众神想要看看他是否能遵守诺言，很快便让他痊愈了。</seg>
<seg id="1809">Now, he hadn't an ox in the world, so he made a hundred little oxen out of tallow and offered them up on an altar, at the same time saying, "Ye gods, I call you to witness that I have discharged my vow."</seg>
<seg id="1809">他其实根本没有一百头牛，于是就用酥油做成了一百头小牛，放到供台上供奉给众神，同时嘴里还说着：“众神灵，我请你们来见证，我已经还清了自己许下的愿。”</seg>
<seg id="1810">The gods determined to be even with him, so they sent him a dream, in which he was bidden to go to the sea-shore and fetch a hundred crowns which he was to find there.</seg>
<seg id="1810">众神决定要报复他，便带他进入了一个梦境。在梦里，他被命令到海边去，在那里他将找到一百个银元。</seg>
<seg id="1811">Hastening in great excitement to the shore, he fell in with a band of robbers, who seized him and carried him off to sell as a slave: and when they sold him a hundred crowns was the sum he fetched.</seg>
<seg id="1811">他带着激动的心情赶忙跑到海边，可是却遇上了一群强盗，强盗抓住他并将他卖了去当奴隶，而卖他所得的钱正好是一百个银元，也就是他要取的总数目。</seg>
<seg id="1812">Do not promise more than you can perform.</seg>
<seg id="1812">不要许下力所不能及的愿。</seg>
<seg id="1813">THE DOGS AND THE HIDES</seg>
<seg id="1813">狗和牛皮</seg>
<seg id="1814">Once upon a time a number of Dogs, who were famished with hunger, saw some Hides steeping in a river, but couldn't get at them because the water was too deep.</seg>
<seg id="1814">从前，有几条饥肠辘辘的狗，看见河里浸泡着一张牛皮，但是由于水太深，他们无法拿到那张皮。</seg>
<seg id="1815">So they put their heads together, and decided to drink away at the river till it was shallow enough for them to reach the Hides.</seg>
<seg id="1815">于是，他们合计着喝掉河里的水，这样就可以趁水浅一些时，过去拿那张牛皮了。</seg>
<seg id="1816">But long before that happened they burst themselves with drinking.</seg>
<seg id="1816">然而，还没等到去拿兽皮，他们的肚皮早已被河水胀破了。</seg>

<seg id="1820">驴将所有猎物平均分成三份，然后谦和地请狮子和狐狸先挑选自己的那一份。</seg>
<seg id="1821">at which the Lion, bursting with fury, sprang upon the Ass and tore him to pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1821">这时，狮子勃然大怒，猛扑过去，撕碎了驴。</seg>
<seg id="1822">Then, glaring at the Fox, he bade him make a fresh division.</seg>
<seg id="1822">接着，狮子又盯上了狐狸，命令他来重新分赃。</seg>
<seg id="1823">The Fox gathered almost the whole in one great heap for the Lion's share, leaving only the smallest possible morsel for himself.</seg>
<seg id="1823">狐狸把所有的猎物都堆在一起，然后请狮子来拿，只留下一点点东西给自己。</seg>
<seg id="1824">"My dear friend," said the Lion, "how did you get the knack of it so well?"</seg>
<seg id="1824">“我的好朋友，”狮子说，“你怎么学到的这个窍门呀？”</seg>
<seg id="1825">The Fox replied, "Me?</seg>
<seg id="1825">狐狸回答说：</seg>
<seg id="1826">Oh, I took a lesson from the Ass."</seg>
<seg id="1826">“我是从驴那里得到了教训。”</seg>
<seg id="1827">Happy is he who learns from the misfortunes of others.</seg>
<seg id="1827">你若懂得从他人的不幸中汲取教训，就能获得幸福。</seg>
<seg id="1828">THE FOWLER, THE PARTRIDGE, AND THE COCK</seg>
<seg id="1828">捕鸟人、鹧鸪和公鸡</seg>
<seg id="1829">One day, as a Fowler was sitting down to a scanty supper of herbs and bread, a friend dropped in unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="1829">有一天，当捕鸟人正坐在餐桌边吃着仅有香草和面包的晚餐时，一个朋友不期而至。</seg>
<seg id="1830">The larder was empty;</seg>
<seg id="1830">食品柜已经空了，</seg>
<seg id="1831">so he went out and caught a tame Partridge, which he kept as a decoy, and was about to wring her neck when she cried, "Surely you won't kill me?</seg>
<seg id="1831">于是捕鸟人跑出去捉那只驯养的鹧鸪，它可是一直被当做诱饵留下来的。就在捕鸟人要拧断她的脖子时，鹧鸪大喊道：“你确定要杀了我吗？</seg>
<seg id="1832">Why, what will you do without me next time you go fowling?</seg>
<seg id="1832">为什么，要是没有我，你下次捕鸟时该怎么办呢？</seg>
<seg id="1833">How will you get the birds to come to your nets?"</seg>
<seg id="1833">你如何能吸引那些鸟儿走到你的网里来呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1834">He let her go at this, and went to his hen-house, where he had a plump young Cock.</seg>
<seg id="1834">听了这番话，捕鸟人就放了鹧鸪，走到鸡舍那边，准备去捉那只胖乎乎的小公鸡。</seg>
<seg id="1835">When the Cock saw what he was after, he too pleaded for his life, and said, "If you kill me, how will you know the time of night?</seg>
<seg id="1835">公鸡看到自己将要成为下一个被杀的目标，也求主人饶命，并且说：“如果你杀了我，怎么能知道夜晚的时间呢？</seg>
<seg id="1836">and who will wake you up in the morning when it is time to get to work?"</seg>
<seg id="1836">谁能在清晨唤醒你，到时候该去干活了呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1837">The Fowler, however, replied, "You are useful for telling the time, I know;</seg>
<seg id="1837">然而，捕鸟人却回答说：“我知道，你的确能告诉我时间，</seg>
<seg id="1838">but, for all that, I can't send my friend supperless to bed."</seg>
<seg id="1838">尽管如此，我也不能让朋友饿着肚子去睡觉呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1839">And therewith he caught him and wrung his neck.</seg>
<seg id="1839">随后，他便捉住公鸡，拧断了它的脖子。</seg>
<seg id="1840">THE GNAT AND THE LION</seg>
<seg id="1840">蚊子和狮子</seg>
<seg id="1841">A Gnat once went up to a Lion and said, "I am not in the least afraid of you:</seg>
<seg id="1841">有只蚊子飞到狮子那里，说：“我一点儿也不害怕你，</seg>
<seg id="1842">I don't even allow that you are a match for me in strength.</seg>
<seg id="1842">我甚至都不承认你我力量相当。</seg>
<seg id="1843">What does your strength amount to after all?</seg>
<seg id="1843">你的力量究竟有多大？</seg>
<seg id="1844">That you can scratch with your claws and bite with your teeth--just like a woman in a temper--and nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="1844">你只会用爪子抓、用牙齿咬，就像一个发脾气的女人一样，除此之外，就没有什么了。</seg>
<seg id="1845">But I'm stronger than you:</seg>
<seg id="1845">可是，我却比你厉害得多。</seg>
<seg id="1846">if you don't believe it, let us fight and see."</seg>
<seg id="1846">若是你不相信，不妨来比试比试。”</seg>
<seg id="1847">So saying, the Gnat sounded his horn, and darted in and bit the Lion on the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1847">蚊子嗡嗡地吹着小喇叭，猛冲上前，在狮子的鼻子上咬了一口。</seg>
<seg id="1848">When the Lion felt the sting, in his haste to crush him he scratched his nose badly, and made it bleed, but failed altogether to hurt the Gnat, which buzzed off in triumph, elated by its victory.</seg>
<seg id="1848">狮子感觉到被蚊子叮了一口，马上就用爪子去抓，结果却划伤了自己的鼻子，流了好多血。狮子最终没能伤害到蚊子。于是，蚊子又嗡嗡叫着，兴高采烈地凯旋而归。</seg>
<seg id="1849">Presently, however, it got entangled in a spider's web, and was caught and eaten by the spider, thus falling a prey to an insignificant insect after having triumphed over the King of the Beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1849">然而，他很快就陷入了蜘蛛的网中，被一只蜘蛛抓住吃了，在战胜了百兽之王后，却被一只不起眼的蜘蛛消灭了。</seg>
<seg id="1850">THE FARMER AND HIS DOGS</seg>
<seg id="1850">农场主和他的狗</seg>
<seg id="1851">A Farmer was snowed up in his farmstead by a severe storm, and was unable to go out and procure provisions for himself and his family.</seg>
<seg id="1851">一个农夫因持续而来的风暴被困在自己的农场里，无法外出为自己和家人寻获食物。</seg>
<seg id="1852">So he first killed his sheep and used them for food;</seg>
<seg id="1852">迫于无奈，他杀死了自己的绵羊来充饥。</seg>
<seg id="1853">then, as the storm still continued, he killed his goats;</seg>
<seg id="1853">可是，风暴依然持续不停，继而又杀死山羊。</seg>
<seg id="1854">and, last of all, as the weather showed no signs of improving, he was compelled to kill his oxen and eat them.</seg>
<seg id="1854">最后，因为风暴丝毫没有减弱的意思，他又被迫杀死了自己的牛来填饱肚子。</seg>
<seg id="1855">When his Dogs saw the various animals being killed and eaten in turn, they said to one another, "We had better get out of this or we shall be the next to go!"</seg>
<seg id="1855">那些狗看到不同的动物依次被杀、被吃掉后，便相互诉说：“我们最好快点离开这里，不然就会成为下一个被杀的对象！”</seg>
<seg id="1856">THE EAGLE AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1856">老鹰和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1857">An Eagle and a Fox became great friends and determined to live near one another:</seg>
<seg id="1857">一只鹰和一只狐狸成为了好朋友，并决定比邻而居，</seg>
<seg id="1858">they thought that the more they saw of each other the better friends they would be.</seg>
<seg id="1858">他们以为经常能见到对方，就会维持更好的友谊。</seg>
<seg id="1859">So the Eagle built a nest at the top of a high tree, while the Fox settled in a thicket at the foot of it and produced a litter of cubs.</seg>
<seg id="1859">于是，老鹰在一棵大树的顶端建巢育子，而狐狸则走进树下的灌木丛中扎窝，并在那里生儿育女。</seg>
<seg id="1860">One day the Fox went out foraging for food, and the Eagle, who also wanted food for her young, flew down into the thicket, caught up the Fox's cubs, and carried them up into the tree for a meal for herself and her family.</seg>
<seg id="1860">有一天，狐狸出去觅食，老鹰正好也想给小鹰寻找食物，他便飞入灌木丛中，抓起狐狸的幼崽，飞上高枝，与雏鹰一起饱餐了一顿。</seg>
<seg id="1861">When the Fox came back, and found out what had happened, she was not so much sorry for the loss of her cubs as furious because she couldn't get at the Eagle and pay her out for her treachery.</seg>
<seg id="1861">待狐狸回来后，发现了老鹰的所作所为，她既为儿女的亡命而悲痛，又因自己无法到老鹰的巢穴吃掉她的幼崽报仇而愤怒。</seg>
<seg id="1862">So she sat down not far off and cursed her.</seg>
<seg id="1862">因此，她只好坐在不远的地方诅咒敌人。</seg>
<seg id="1863">But it wasn't long before she had her revenge.</seg>
<seg id="1863">没过多久，她就报了仇。</seg>
<seg id="1864">Some villagers happened to be sacrificing a goat on a neighbouring altar, and the Eagle flew down and carried off a piece of burning flesh to her nest.</seg>
<seg id="1864">一些村民碰巧在旁边的祭坛杀羊祭神，老鹰飞下来，从祭坛上抓起一块还带着火苗的羊肉，带回到自己的巢里。</seg>
<seg id="1865">There was a strong wind blowing, and the nest caught fire, with the result that her fledglings fell half-roasted to the ground.</seg>
<seg id="1865">这时，一阵狂风吹来，鹰巢立刻起火了，结果，那些快要被烧焦了的小雏鹰也一并掉到了地上。</seg>
<seg id="1866">Then the Fox ran to the spot and devoured them in full sight of the Eagle.</seg>
<seg id="1866">接着，狐狸便跑了过去，在老鹰的眼前，吃掉了那些小鹰。</seg>
<seg id="1867">False faith may escape human punishment, but cannot escape the divine.</seg>
<seg id="1867">带有欺骗性的忠诚或许能逃过人的惩罚，但却逃不过神的惩罚。</seg>
<seg id="1868">THE BUTCHER AND HIS CUSTOMERS</seg>
<seg id="1868">屠夫和他的顾客</seg>
<seg id="1869">Two Men were buying meat at a Butcher's stall in the market-place, and, while the Butcher's back was turned for a moment, one of them snatched up a joint and hastily thrust it under the other's cloak, where it could not be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1869">两个人正在市场里屠户的摊位上买肉，屠夫刚一转身背向他们，其中一人便抓起一块腱子肉，迅速放进另一人的斗篷里，谁也没看到他的举动。</seg>
<seg id="1870">When the Butcher turned round, he missed the meat at once, and charged them with having stolen it:</seg>
<seg id="1870">待屠夫转过身来，立刻注意到少了一块肉，便指控他们偷了肉。</seg>
<seg id="1871">but the one who had taken it said he hadn't got it, and the one who had got it said he hadn't taken it.</seg>
<seg id="1871">但是，拿了肉的那个人说自己没有偷，而得到肉的那个人也说自己没有拿。</seg>
<seg id="1872">The Butcher felt sure they were deceiving him, but he only said, "You may cheat me with your lying, but you can't cheat the gods, and they won't let you off so lightly."</seg>
<seg id="1872">屠夫确信他们是在欺骗自己，但仅仅说了一句话：“你可以用谎言来欺骗我，但却骗不了神，他们不会这么轻易放过你的。”</seg>
<seg id="1873">Prevarication often amounts to perjury.</seg>
<seg id="1873">相互推诿等同于欺骗。</seg>
<seg id="1874">HERCULES AND MINERVA</seg>
<seg id="1874">赫拉克勒斯和密涅瓦</seg>
<seg id="1875">Hercules was once travelling along a narrow road when he saw lying on the ground in front of him what appeared to be an apple, and as he passed he stamped upon it with his heel.</seg>
<seg id="1875">赫拉克勒斯有一次经过一条狭窄的路时，见到前面的地上有一个类似苹果的东西，走到那里时，他便用脚去踩它。</seg>
<seg id="1876">To his astonishment, instead of being crushed it doubled in size;</seg>
<seg id="1876">让他惊讶的是，那个东西不但没有碎，反而成倍增大了。</seg>
<seg id="1877">and, on his attacking it again and smiting it with his club, it swelled up to an enormous size and blocked up the whole road.</seg>
<seg id="1877">他又去踩了一下，而且还用大木棒去打它。结果，那个东西迅速膨胀起来，堵住了整条路。</seg>
<seg id="1878">Upon this he dropped his club, and stood looking at it in amazement.</seg>
<seg id="1878">他扔下木棒，不知所措地站在那里盯着看。</seg>
<seg id="1879">Just then Minerva appeared, and said to him, "Leave it alone, my friend;</seg>
<seg id="1879">这时，密涅瓦出现了，对他说：“朋友，随他去吧，</seg>
<seg id="1880">that which you see before you is the apple of discord:</seg>
<seg id="1880">你眼前看到的正是那个祸根。</seg>
<seg id="1881">if you do not meddle with it, it remains small as it was at first, but if you resort to violence it swells into the thing you see."</seg>
<seg id="1881">如果你不去理它，它就会依然小如苹果一样待在原地，可是，如果你采用暴力与之抗衡，它就会变成你看到的这个样子了。”</seg>
<seg id="1882">THE FOX WHO SERVED A LION</seg>
<seg id="1882">为狮子服务的狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1883">A Lion had a Fox to attend on him, and whenever they went hunting the Fox found the prey and the Lion fell upon it and killed it, and then they divided it between them in certain proportions.</seg>
<seg id="1883">狮子身边有一只狐狸在服侍他，每当出去打猎时，狐狸负责寻找猎物，而狮子则扑上去杀死猎物，之后他们按照一定比例瓜分猎物。</seg>
<seg id="1884">But the Lion always got a very large share, and the Fox a very small one, which didn't please the latter at all;</seg>
<seg id="1884">但狮子总会取走大部分猎物，而狐狸只能得到小小的一份，这让狐狸很不高兴。</seg>
<seg id="1885">so he determined to set up on his own account.</seg>
<seg id="1885">于是，狐狸决心自己去捕猎。</seg>
<seg id="1886">He began by trying to steal a lamb from a flock of sheep: but the shepherd saw him and set his dogs on him.</seg>
<seg id="1886">起初，他尝试着从羊群中偷取羔羊，但是牧羊人一见到狐狸，便放狗追他。</seg>
<seg id="1887">The hunter was now the hunted, and was very soon caught and despatched by the dogs.</seg>
<seg id="1887">原来的捕猎者，现在反而变成被猎者，而且狐狸很快就被狗捉住杀死了。</seg>
<seg id="1888">Better servitude with safety than freedom with danger.</seg>
<seg id="1888">安全的奴役更胜于有危险的自由。</seg>
<seg id="1889">THE QUACK DOCTOR</seg>
<seg id="1889">江湖郎中</seg>
<seg id="1890">A certain man fell sick and took to his bed.</seg>
<seg id="1890">从前，有一个人生病了，且卧床不起。</seg>
<seg id="1891">He consulted a number of doctors from time to time, and they all, with one exception, told him that his life was in no immediate danger, but that his illness would probably last a considerable time.</seg>
<seg id="1891">他咨询了很多医生，除了一个医生之外，其他人都说这病没有什么危险，但却需要持续一段时间。</seg>
<seg id="1892">The one who took a different view of his case, who was also the last to be consulted, bade him prepare for the worst:</seg>
<seg id="1892">那个持相反意见的医生，也是他最后咨询的一个医生，命令他做最坏的打算。</seg>
<seg id="1893">"You have not twenty-four hours to live," said he, "and I fear I can do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1893">“你已经活不过明天了，”那人说，“恐怕我也帮不上什么忙。”</seg>
<seg id="1894">As it turned out, however, he was quite wrong;</seg>
<seg id="1894">然而，事实证明那个医生的确是错了。</seg>
<seg id="1895">for at the end of a few days the sick man quitted his bed and took a walk abroad, looking, it is true, as pale as a ghost.</seg>
<seg id="1895">过了些日子，尽管病人的脸色依然苍白，可他能够下床走动了。</seg>
<seg id="1896">In the course of his walk he met the Doctor who had prophesied his death.</seg>
<seg id="1896">在路上，他又遇见了那个宣判他死期将至的医生。</seg>
<seg id="1897">"Dear me," said the latter, "how do you do?</seg>
<seg id="1897">医生问他：“你好，感觉如何？</seg>
<seg id="1898">You are fresh from the other world, no doubt.</seg>
<seg id="1898">不用问，你从另一个世界回来了。</seg>
<seg id="1899">Pray, how are our departed friends getting on there?"</seg>
<seg id="1899">拜托，那些死去的朋友怎么样？”</seg>
<seg id="1900">"Most comfortably," replied the other, "for they have drunk the water of oblivion, and have forgotten all the troubles of life.</seg>
<seg id="1900">“非常舒服，”病人回答说，“因为他们喝了忘情水，忘掉了生命中的所有烦恼。</seg>
<seg id="1901">By the way, just before I left, the authorities were making arrangements to prosecute all the doctors, because they won't let sick men die in the course of nature, but use their arts to keep them alive.</seg>
<seg id="1901">顺便一提，就在我离开前，死神正准备控诉所有医生，因为他们没让病人自然死亡，而是利用各种方式来挽救其生命。</seg>
<seg id="1902">They were going to charge you along with the rest, till I assured them that you were no doctor, but a mere impostor."</seg>
<seg id="1902">原本你也在其中，但是我恳求他们放了你，因为你不是一个真正的医生，而仅仅是个江湖郎中。”</seg>
<seg id="1903">THE LION, THE WOLF, AND THE FOX</seg>
<seg id="1903">狮子、狼和狐狸</seg>
<seg id="1904">A Lion, infirm with age, lay sick in his den, and all the beasts of the forest came to inquire after his health with the exception of the Fox.</seg>
<seg id="1904">一只上了年纪的狮子，生病躺在自己的洞里。除了狐狸外，森林里的其他动物都来问候狮子。</seg>
<seg id="1905">The Wolf thought this was a good opportunity for paying off old scores against the Fox, so he called the attention of the Lion to his absence, and said, "You see, sire, that we have all come to see how you are except the Fox, who hasn't come near you, and doesn't care whether you are well or ill."</seg>
<seg id="1905">狼心想，这正是一个好机会，可以和狐狸算算旧账了。于是，他便提醒狮子注意到狐狸的缺席，并且说：“您看，大王，我们所有动物都来看望您，可狐狸却胆大包天，竟然不来问候。他根本都不关心您的健康状况是好是坏。”</seg>
<seg id="1906">Just then the Fox came in and heard the last words of the Wolf.</seg>
<seg id="1906">正在此时，狐狸进来了，听到了狼所说的最后一句话。</seg>
<seg id="1907">The Lion roared at him in deep displeasure, but he begged to be allowed to explain his absence, and said, "Not one of them cares for you so much as I, sire, for all the time I have been going round to the doctors and trying to find a cure for your illness."</seg>
<seg id="1907">狮子立刻冲狐狸怒吼起来，狐狸马上请求让他解释一下缺席的原因。狐狸说：“他们谁也没有我这样关心您，我一直在四处奔走，遍访名医，为您寻找治病的妙方呢！”</seg>
<seg id="1908">"And may I ask if you have found one?" said the Lion.</seg>
<seg id="1908">“我问一下，你找到了什么？”狮子说。</seg>
<seg id="1909">"I have, sire," said the Fox, "and it is this: you must flay a Wolf and wrap yourself in his skin while it is still warm."</seg>
<seg id="1909">“我找到了一个灵丹妙方，那就是——您必须活剥了狼，趁着它的皮还有体温时，赶紧披在身上。”</seg>
<seg id="1910">The Lion accordingly turned to the Wolf and struck him dead with one blow of his paw, in order to try the Fox's prescription;</seg>
<seg id="1910">为了试一下狐狸的偏方，狮子立刻转向狼，用一只爪子掐死了狼，</seg>
<seg id="1911">but the Fox laughed and said to himself, "That's what comes of stirring up ill-will."</seg>
<seg id="1911">而狐狸则笑着自言自语道：“这可是你自己激发出来的敌意。”</seg>
<seg id="1912">HERCULES AND PLUTUS</seg>
<seg id="1912">赫拉克勒斯和财神</seg>
<seg id="1913">When Hercules was received among the gods and was entertained at a banquet by Jupiter, he responded courteously to the greetings of all with the exception of Plutus, the god of wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1913">赫拉克勒斯被众神接纳为神以后，朱庇特为他设宴庆贺。宴会上，赫拉克勒斯热情友好地向众神们一一问好，唯独财神普路托斯除外。</seg>
<seg id="1914">When Plutus approached him, he cast his eyes upon the ground, and turned away and pretended not to see him.</seg>
<seg id="1914">当财神向他走去时，他却低下头盯着地面看，然后转身走开了，假装没有看到他。</seg>
<seg id="1915">Jupiter was surprised at this conduct on his part, and asked why, after having been so cordial with all the other gods, he had behaved like that to Plutus.</seg>
<seg id="1915">朱庇特看到他的举动十分惊讶，便问他为什么与其他神都能高兴地打招呼，唯独对财神普路托斯却另眼相看。</seg>
<seg id="1916">"Sire," said Hercules, "I do not like Plutus, and I will tell you why.</seg>
<seg id="1916">赫拉克勒斯回答说：“陛下，我不喜欢财神普路托斯，我会告诉您原因的。</seg>
<seg id="1917">When we were on earth together I always noticed that he was to be found in the company of scoundrels."</seg>
<seg id="1917">当我们俩都在人间时，总见到他与坏人在一起。”</seg>
<seg id="1918">THE FOX AND THE LEOPARD</seg>

<seg id="1919">A Fox and a Leopard were disputing about their looks, and each claimed to be the more handsome of the two.</seg>
<seg id="1919">一只狐狸和一只豹正在争论自己的外表，争着吹嘘自己是更俊朗的那一个。</seg>
<seg id="1920">The Leopard said, "Look at my smart coat; you have nothing to match that."</seg>
<seg id="1920">豹说：“看看我这漂亮的外套，你可没有什么能与之媲美的。”</seg>
<seg id="1921">But the Fox replied, "Your coat may be smart, but my wits are smarter still."</seg>
<seg id="1921">可是，狐狸却说：“你的外表或许比较漂亮，但我的智慧却更胜过你。”</seg>
<seg id="1922">THE FOX AND THE HEDGEHOG</seg>
<seg id="1922">狐狸与刺猬</seg>
<seg id="1923">A Fox, in swimming across a rapid river, was swept away by the current and carried a long way downstream in spite of his struggles, until at last, bruised and exhausted, he managed to scramble on to dry ground from a backwater.</seg>
<seg id="1923">一只狐狸正在渡过一条水流湍急的河，尽管他努力挣扎着，可依然被水流冲到了远处的河下游。后来，遍体鳞伤的他精疲力竭，想尽一切办法从水中爬回到了一块干燥的土地上，躺在那里一动也不能动。</seg>
<seg id="1924">As he lay there unable to move, a swarm of horseflies settled on him and sucked his blood undisturbed, for he was too weak even to shake them off.</seg>
<seg id="1924">这时，一群饥饿的马蝇叮满了他的全身，泰然自若地吮吸着他的血。因为狐狸实在太虚弱，根本无法抖落这些马蝇。</seg>
<seg id="1925">A Hedgehog saw him, and asked if he should brush away the flies that were tormenting him;</seg>
<seg id="1925">一只刺猬看见了他，并问他是否应该赶走这些害他的马蝇。</seg>
<seg id="1926">but the Fox replied, "Oh, please, no, not on any account, for these flies have sucked their fill and are taking very little from me now;</seg>
<seg id="1926">但是，狐狸却回答说：“不用啦，坚决不要打扰他们，因为这些马蝇已经吃饱，不再叮咬我了；</seg>
<seg id="1927">but, if you drive them off, another swarm of hungry ones will come and suck all the blood I have left, and leave me without a drop in my veins."</seg>
<seg id="1927">假如你把它们都赶走了，另外一群饥饿的马蝇就会过来，继续吸取我体内剩余的血，这样就会吸干血管里的血。”</seg>
<seg id="1928">THE CROW AND THE RAVEN</seg>
<seg id="1928">乌鸦与渡鸦</seg>

<seg id="1929">一只乌鸦非常妒忌渡鸦，因为渡鸦被人类当做一种能预测未来的神鸟，故而得到了人类的尊敬。</seg>

<seg id="1932">听到乌鸦的声音，行人都很郁闷，他们担心这是一个不好的预兆。</seg>
<seg id="1933">till one of them, spying the Crow, said to his companions, "It's all right, my friends, we can go on without fear, for it's only a crow and that means nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1933">其中一个人看到了乌鸦，就对同伴说：“没事了，朋友们，我们可以不用担心了，因为这是一只乌鸦，没什么特别的。”</seg>
<seg id="1934">Those who pretend to be something they are not only make themselves ridiculous.</seg>

<seg id="1937">and she drove a brisk trade, and made a fat livelihood out of it.</seg>
<seg id="1937">她四处招摇撞骗，因此得到了不少酬金。</seg>
<seg id="1938">But certain persons accused her of black magic and carried her before the judges, and demanded that she should be put to death for dealings with the Devil.</seg>
<seg id="1938">但是，后来有人控告她乱用巫术，便将她送上了法庭，并要求将她处死，因为她与魔鬼打交道。</seg>
<seg id="1939">She was found guilty and condemned to death:</seg>
<seg id="1939">后来，她被定了罪，并判处了死刑。</seg>
<seg id="1940">and one of the judges said to her as she was leaving the dock, "You say you can avert the anger of the gods.</seg>
<seg id="1940">在离开被告席时，其中一个法官对她说：“你自称能平息神灵的愤怒，</seg>
<seg id="1941">How comes it, then, that you have failed to disarm the enmity of men?"</seg>
<seg id="1941">那么，现在为何连凡人的愤怒也平息不了呢？”</seg>
<seg id="1942">THE OLD MAN AND DEATH</seg>
<seg id="1942">老人与死神</seg>
<seg id="1943">An Old Man cut himself a bundle of faggots in a wood and started to carry them home.</seg>
<seg id="1943">有一个老人在森林里砍了一些柴，准备运回家。</seg>
<seg id="1944">He had a long way to go, and was tired out before he had got much more than half-way.</seg>
<seg id="1944">他十分吃力地挑着走了很远的路，还没走到一半，就已经累得走不动了。</seg>
<seg id="1945">Casting his burden on the ground, he called upon Death to come and release him from his life of toil.</seg>
<seg id="1945">他便将担子放在地上，要求死神快点来，让他尽快摆脱这个痛苦的生命。</seg>
<seg id="1946">The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him.</seg>
<seg id="1946">更令他沮丧的是，还没等话说出口，死神便站在他面前，声称已经准备好为他服务了。</seg>
<seg id="1947">He was almost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out, "Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help me up with my burden again."</seg>
<seg id="1947">老人几乎吓呆了，但却保持着沉着镇定，结结巴巴地说：“好人呀，你行行好，帮忙把那担子再放到我肩上吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1948">THE MISER</seg>
<seg id="1948">吝啬鬼</seg>
<seg id="1949">A Miser sold everything he had, and melted down his hoard of gold into a single lump, which he buried secretly in a field.</seg>
<seg id="1949">有一个守财奴变卖了所有家产，并将所有金器全部熔成了一个大金块，秘密埋在一个地方。</seg>
<seg id="1950">Every day he went to look at it, and would sometimes spend long hours gloating over his treasure.</seg>
<seg id="1950">他每天都会走过去看看，有时还会花很长时间得意洋洋地欣赏自己的宝藏。</seg>
<seg id="1951">One of his men noticed his frequent visits to the spot, and one day watched him and discovered his secret.</seg>
<seg id="1951">一个仆人注意到他经常去那个地方，便在某一天监视着他，发现了他的秘密。</seg>
<seg id="1952">Waiting his opportunity, he went one night and dug up the gold and stole it.</seg>
<seg id="1952">那人在一个夜晚伺机挖出了金块，并偷走了。</seg>
<seg id="1953">Next day the Miser visited the place as usual, and, finding his treasure gone, fell to tearing his hair and groaning over his loss.</seg>
<seg id="1953">第二天，当守财奴又像往常一样到那里来看宝贝时，发现自己的宝藏不翼而飞了，便捶胸顿足地痛哭起来。</seg>
<seg id="1954">In this condition he was seen by one of his neighbours, who asked him what his trouble was.</seg>
<seg id="1954">一个邻居见他如此悲痛，便问他遇上了什么麻烦。</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Miser told him of his misfortune;</seg>
<seg id="1955">守财奴告诉他自己的不幸，</seg>
<seg id="1956">but the other replied, "Don't take it so much to heart, my friend;</seg>
<seg id="1956">可是，邻居却说：“朋友，别太放在心上了，</seg>
<seg id="1957">put a brick into the hole, and take a look at it every day:</seg>
<seg id="1957">找一块石头放进洞里，然后每天都来看看它，</seg>
<seg id="1958">you won't be any worse off than before, for even when you had your gold it was of no earthly use to you."</seg>
<seg id="1958">只要你心里想着那是块金子，就不会再如此难过了。因为即使那是一块真的金子，对你来说也没什么用呀。”</seg>
<seg id="1959">THE FOXES AND THE RIVER</seg>
<seg id="1959">狐狸与河</seg>
<seg id="1960">A number of Foxes assembled on the bank of a river and wanted to drink;</seg>
<seg id="1960">一群狐狸聚集在河畔，想要喝河里的水。</seg>
<seg id="1961">but the current was so strong and the water looked so deep and dangerous that they didn't dare to do so, but stood near the edge encouraging one another not to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1961">但是，河里的水流很急，而河水似乎又很深、很危险，于是，他们都不敢下去喝水，只是站在河边，鼓动其他不害怕的狐狸下去喝水。</seg>
<seg id="1962">At last one of them, to shame the rest, and show how brave he was, said, "I am not a bit frightened!</seg>
<seg id="1962">其中有一只狐狸，嘲笑同伴们太胆小，为显示自己的勇敢，他说道：“我才不害怕呢！</seg>
<seg id="1963">See, I'll step right into the water!"</seg>
<seg id="1963">看吧，我马上就走进河里去！”</seg>
<seg id="1964">He had no sooner done so than the current swept him off his feet.</seg>
<seg id="1964">他刚步入河中，就被湍急的河水冲得站不稳脚跟。</seg>
<seg id="1965">When the others saw him being carried down-stream they cried, "Don't go and leave us!</seg>
<seg id="1965">眼看他就要被河水冲到下游去了，站在河边的其他狐狸冲他大喊：“别走呀，不要留下我们！</seg>
<seg id="1966">Come back and show us where we too can drink with safety."</seg>
<seg id="1966">快回来，告诉我们从哪里可以安全地下去喝水。”</seg>
<seg id="1967">But he replied, "I'm afraid I can't yet:</seg>
<seg id="1967">然而，被水冲走的狐狸却回答说：“恐怕我不能回去了，</seg>
<seg id="1968">I want to go to the seaside, and this current will take me there nicely.</seg>
<seg id="1968">我想到海边去，河水会带我过去的。</seg>
<seg id="1969">When I come back I'll show you with pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="1969">等我回来后，再告诉你们吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1970">THE HORSE AND THE STAG</seg>
<seg id="1970">马和雄鹿</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was once a Horse who used to graze in a meadow which he had all to himself.</seg>
<seg id="1971">从前，有一匹马曾经独自占有一片草场。</seg>
<seg id="1972">But one day a Stag came into the meadow, and said he had as good a right to feed there as the Horse, and moreover chose all the best places for himself.</seg>
<seg id="1972">有一天，一只雄鹿闯入了他的领地，说自己也像马一样有权利分享这里的草，不仅如此，还为自己选了一个最好的地方吃草。</seg>
<seg id="1973">The Horse, wishing to be revenged upon his unwelcome visitor, went to a man and asked if he would help him to turn out the Stag.</seg>
<seg id="1973">马一心想报复这只不请自来的鹿，便来到人那里询问是否能帮助自己惩罚鹿。</seg>
<seg id="1974">"Yes," said the man, "I will by all means; but I can only do so if you let me put a bridle in your mouth and mount on your back."</seg>
<seg id="1974">人回答说：“是的，我可以尽力帮你，不过，除非你愿意让我把一根勒马的缰绳放在你嘴里，并且骑在你的背上，我才能这么做。”</seg>
<seg id="1975">The Horse agreed to this, and the two together very soon turned the Stag out of the pasture:</seg>
<seg id="1975">马同意了人的要求，于是这两个合作者很快就把鹿赶出了草场。</seg>
<seg id="1976">but when that was done, the Horse found to his dismay that in the man he had got a master for good.</seg>
<seg id="1976">然而，一切结束后，马才发现自己永远成了人的奴隶。</seg>
<seg id="1977">THE FOX AND THE BRAMBLE</seg>
<seg id="1977">狐狸与荆棘</seg>
<seg id="1978">In making his way through a hedge a Fox missed his footing and caught at a Bramble to save himself from falling.</seg>
<seg id="1978">一只狐狸爬越篱笆时，差一点失足跌落下去，他拼命地抓住了一根荆棘，以防掉下去摔死。</seg>
<seg id="1979">Naturally, he got badly scratched, and in disgust he cried to the Bramble, "It was your help I wanted, and see how you have treated me!</seg>
<seg id="1979">狐狸自然被荆棘刺伤了，他厌恶地冲着荆棘大喊：“我只想得到你的帮助，可你却如此对待我！</seg>
<seg id="1980">I'd sooner have fallen outright."</seg>
<seg id="1980">还不如直接摔下去呢。”</seg>
<seg id="1981">The Bramble, interrupting him, replied, "You must have lost your wits, my friend, to catch at me, who am myself always catching at others."</seg>
<seg id="1981">荆棘打断了他的话，说：“朋友，向来都是我拉扯别人的，而你却来抓住我，那可就是你的愚蠢了。”</seg>
<seg id="1982">THE LION, THE FOX, AND THE STAG</seg>
<seg id="1982">狮子、狐狸和雄鹿</seg>
<seg id="1983">A Lion lay sick in his den, unable to provide himself with food.</seg>
<seg id="1983">一只生病的狮子躺在自己的洞里，没办法亲自去寻找食物。</seg>
<seg id="1984">So he said to his friend the Fox, who came to ask how he did, "My good friend, I wish you would go to yonder wood and beguile the big Stag, who lives there, to come to my den:</seg>
<seg id="1984">于是，他对前来探望自己的朋友——狐狸说：“我的好朋友，我希望你能到那片森林里去，用花言巧语把住在那里的一只最大的鹿骗到这里来，</seg>
<seg id="1985">I have a fancy to make my dinner off a stag's heart and brains."</seg>
<seg id="1985">我很想吃掉他的心和脑子。”</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Fox went to the wood and found the Stag and said to him, "My dear sir, you're in luck.</seg>
<seg id="1986">狐狸来到树林里，看见了那只雄鹿，便对他说：“亲爱的朋友，你走运了。</seg>
<seg id="1987">You know the Lion, our King:</seg>
<seg id="1987">你知道我们的国王狮子吧，</seg>
<seg id="1988">well, he's at the point of death, and has appointed you his successor to rule over the beasts.</seg>
<seg id="1988">是的，他快要死了，可是却指名要你去继承他的王位，来统治百兽。</seg>
<seg id="1989">I hope you won't forget that I was the first to bring you the good news.</seg>
<seg id="1989">我希望你别忘了，我可是第一个向你报告好消息的。</seg>
<seg id="1990">And now I must be going back to him;</seg>
<seg id="1990">现在，我必须得回到狮子那里去了，</seg>
<seg id="1991">and, if you take my advice, you'll come too and be with him at the last."</seg>
<seg id="1991">如果你肯听我的话，就和我一起去，看他最后一眼吧。”</seg>
<seg id="1992">The Stag was highly flattered, and followed the Fox to the Lion's den, suspecting nothing.</seg>
<seg id="1992">雄鹿非常高兴，毫不设防地跟着狐狸来到了狮子的洞里。</seg>
<seg id="1993">No sooner had he got inside than the Lion sprang upon him, but he misjudged his spring, and the Stag got away with only his ears torn, and returned as fast as he could to the shelter of the wood.</seg>
<seg id="1993">刚一进来，狮子猛然朝鹿扑过来，然而，他错误地估计了自己的实力。雄鹿仅仅被撕扯掉了耳朵，他拼命地逃回树林里的避难处。</seg>
<seg id="1994">The Fox was much mortified, and the Lion, too, was dreadfully disappointed, for he was getting very hungry in spite of his illness.</seg>
<seg id="1994">狐狸很难过，狮子也很失望，因为生了病的他正在忍饥挨饿。</seg>
<seg id="1995">So he begged the Fox to have another try at coaxing the Stag to his den.</seg>
<seg id="1995">于是，狮子请求狐狸再想想办法，用诡计哄骗雄鹿再一次到洞里来。</seg>
<seg id="1996">"It'll be almost impossible this time," said the Fox, "but I'll try";</seg>
<seg id="1996">“这次不太可能了，”狐狸说，“不过，我会再试试。”</seg>
<seg id="1997">and off he went to the wood a second time, and found the Stag resting and trying to recover from his fright.</seg>
<seg id="1997">他又一次来到树林里，发现雄鹿正在休息疗伤。</seg>
<seg id="1998">As soon as he saw the Fox he cried, "You scoundrel, what do you mean by trying to lure me to my death like that?</seg>
<seg id="1998">一见到狐狸，雄鹿就哭喊道：“你这个大坏蛋，像那样骗我去送死，你到底什么意思？</seg>
<seg id="1999">Take yourself off, or I'll do you to death with my horns."</seg>
<seg id="1999">快走开，不然我就用鹿角刺死你。”</seg>
<seg id="2000">But the Fox was entirely shameless.</seg>
<seg id="2000">可是，狐狸却恬不知耻地说：</seg>
<seg id="2001">"What a coward you were," said he; "surely you didn't think the Lion meant any harm?</seg>
<seg id="2001">“你可真是个懦夫，你难道真的认为狮子要伤害你吗？</seg>
<seg id="2002">Why, he was only going to whisper some royal secrets into your ear when you went off like a scared rabbit.</seg>
<seg id="2002">他只是想在你耳边说一些关于王位的秘密罢了，可你却像只受了惊吓的兔子一样跑开了。</seg>
<seg id="2003">You have rather disgusted him, and I'm not sure he won't make the wolf King instead, unless you come back at once and show you've got some spirit.</seg>
<seg id="2003">你已经激怒了他，我不确定他是否要将王位传给狼，除非你立刻回去告诉狮子，你不是这样的胆小鬼。</seg>
<seg id="2004">I promise you he won't hurt you, and I will be your faithful servant."</seg>
<seg id="2004">我向你保证，狮子决不会伤害你，而且我也会做你的忠实奴仆。”</seg>
<seg id="2005">The Stag was foolish enough to be persuaded to return, and this time the Lion made no mistake, but overpowered him, and feasted right royally upon his carcase.</seg>
<seg id="2005">愚蠢的雄鹿又被说服了，再次跟着狐狸回到狮子的洞里。这一次，狮子没有再犯错误，轻易地制服了雄鹿，美美地享受了一顿。</seg>
<seg id="2006">The Fox, meanwhile, watched his chance and, when the Lion wasn't looking, filched away the brains to reward him for his trouble.</seg>
<seg id="2006">在一旁静候的狐狸，瞅准了机会，趁狮子不注意时，偷走了雄鹿的脑子，以此犒劳自己。</seg>
<seg id="2007">Presently the Lion began searching for them, of course without success:</seg>
<seg id="2007">一会儿，狮子开始寻找鹿的脑子，当然找不到了。</seg>
<seg id="2008">and the Fox, who was watching him, said, "I don't think it's much use your looking for the brains:</seg>
<seg id="2008">这时，在一旁观望的狐狸说：“我认为寻找鹿的脑子是白费工夫，</seg>
<seg id="2009">a creature who twice walked into a Lion's den can't have got any."</seg>
<seg id="2009">因为能两次走进狮子洞里来的动物，不可能有脑子。”</seg>
<seg id="2010">THE MAN WHO LOST HIS SPADE</seg>
<seg id="2010">丢了铁锹的人</seg>
<seg id="2011">A Man was engaged in digging over his vineyard, and one day on coming to work he missed his Spade.</seg>
<seg id="2011">一个人在他的葡萄园里掘土，有一天，要开始工作时发现铁锹没了。</seg>
<seg id="2012">Thinking it may have been stolen by one of his labourers, he questioned them closely, but they one and all denied any knowledge of it.</seg>
<seg id="2012">他以为可能是被某个工人偷走了，就过去质问他们，但工人们一个个都否认偷了铁锹。</seg>
<seg id="2013">He was not convinced by their denials, and insisted that they should all go to the town and take oath in a temple that they were not guilty of the theft.</seg>
<seg id="2013">尽管工人都否认了，可他依然不相信，一再坚持所有人都应该到城里的寺庙去发誓，自己没有犯盗窃罪。</seg>
<seg id="2014">This was because he had no great opinion of the simple country deities, but thought that the thief would not pass undetected by the shrewder gods of the town.</seg>
<seg id="2014">这是因为他对小镇上的神灵没有什么概念，以为小偷逃不过城里寺庙精明神灵的检测。</seg>
<seg id="2015">When they got inside the gates the first thing they heard was the town crier proclaiming a reward for information about a thief who had stolen something from the city temple.</seg>
<seg id="2015">他们刚走进大门，就听到了悬赏缉拿从寺庙偷东西的小偷。</seg>
<seg id="2016">"Well," said the Man to himself, "it strikes me I had better go back home again.</seg>
<seg id="2016">“好吧，”这人自言自语地说，“我最好还是赶快回家吧。</seg>
<seg id="2017">If these town gods can't detect the thieves who steal from their own temples, it's scarcely likely they can tell me who stole my Spade."</seg>
<seg id="2017">如果这些庙里的神都无法找到盗窃寺庙东西的贼，他们也不太可能告诉我是谁偷了我的铁锹。”</seg>
<seg id="2018">THE PARTRIDGE AND THE FOWLER</seg>
<seg id="2018">鹧鸪和捕鸟人</seg>
<seg id="2019">A Fowler caught a Partridge in his nets, and was just about to wring its neck when it made a piteous appeal to him to spare its life and said, "Do not kill me, but let me live and I will repay you for your kindness by decoying other partridges into your nets."</seg>
<seg id="2019">有个捕鸟的人在网里捉到一只鹧鸪，正要拧断他的脖子时，鹧鸪带着可怜的表情求他饶了自己的命，并说：“不要杀死我，让我活着吧，我会诱骗其他鹧鸪到你的网里来，以此来回报你对我的仁慈。”</seg>
<seg id="2020">"No," said the Fowler, "I will not spare you.</seg>
<seg id="2020">捕鸟人说：“不，我不能饶了你，</seg>
<seg id="2021">I was going to kill you anyhow, and after that treacherous speech you thoroughly deserve your fate."</seg>
<seg id="2021">无论如何都要杀了你。尤其是听了你这番背叛同类的宣言，你更应该去死了。”</seg>
<seg id="2022">THE HUNTER AND THE WOODMAN</seg>
<seg id="2022">猎人和樵夫</seg>
<seg id="2023">A Hunter was searching in the forest for the tracks of a lion, and, catching sight presently of a Woodman engaged in felling a tree, he went up to him and asked him if he had noticed a lion's footprints anywhere about, or if he knew where his den was.</seg>
<seg id="2023">一个猎人正在森林里搜寻狮子的踪迹，不久，他看到一个樵夫正在砍树，于是便走上前问他有没有注意到狮子的足迹，或者是否知道狮子躲在了哪里。</seg>
<seg id="2024">The Woodman answered, "If you will come with me, I will show you the lion himself."</seg>
<seg id="2024">樵夫回答说：“要是你和我一起去，就能亲自看到狮子了。”</seg>
<seg id="2025">The Hunter turned pale with fear, and his teeth chattered as he replied, "Oh, I'm not looking for the lion, thanks, but only for his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="2025">猎人吓得脸色惨白，牙齿打着颤说道：“我只想搜寻它的踪迹，并不是在找狮子本身。”</seg>
<seg id="2026">THE SERPENT AND THE EAGLE</seg>
<seg id="2026">毒蛇和鹰</seg>
<seg id="2027">An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it.</seg>
<seg id="2027">一只老鹰朝着一条毒蛇俯冲下来，用鹰爪抓住了蛇，想要把他带走并吃掉。</seg>
<seg id="2028">But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment;</seg>
<seg id="2028">可是，毒蛇却迅速缠住了老鹰，</seg>
<seg id="2029">and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two.</seg>
<seg id="2029">接着展开了一场生死搏斗。</seg>
<seg id="2030">A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape.</seg>
<seg id="2030">一个农夫看到了整个过程，走过来帮老鹰解开了蛇的缠绕，让他重新获得了自由。</seg>
<seg id="2031">In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn.</seg>
<seg id="2031">为了报复农夫，蛇便将自己的毒液注进了农夫喝水的角杯里。</seg>
<seg id="2032">Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground.</seg>
<seg id="2032">忙活了半天的农夫正想去解解渴，便拿起角杯要喝水，这时，老鹰飞过来撞掉了他手中的角杯，杯子里的水全都洒在了地上。</seg>
<seg id="2033">One good turn deserves another.</seg>
<seg id="2033">善有善报。</seg>
<seg id="2034">THE ROGUE AND THE ORACLE</seg>
<seg id="2034">无赖和圣人</seg>
<seg id="2035">A Rogue laid a wager that he would prove the Oracle at Delphi to be untrustworthy by procuring from it a false reply to an inquiry by himself.</seg>
<seg id="2035">一个狡猾的人下赌注，他能让德尔斐（希腊古都）的圣人用错误的回答来证明自己不值得信赖。</seg>
<seg id="2036">So he went to the temple on the appointed day with a small bird in his hand, which he concealed under the folds of his cloak, and asked whether what he held in his hand were alive or dead.</seg>
<seg id="2036">于是，到了约定好的那一天，他来到了庙里，手里拿着一只小麻雀，并将它藏在外衣里面。他问圣人自己手中拿着的东西是活的还是死的。</seg>
<seg id="2037">If the Oracle said "dead," he meant to produce the bird alive:</seg>
<seg id="2037">如果圣人说“是死的”，他便把活着的麻雀拿出来；</seg>
<seg id="2038">if the reply was "alive," he intended to wring its neck and show it to be dead.</seg>
<seg id="2038">如果圣人说“是活的”，他就捏死麻雀，然后再将死的拿出来。</seg>
<seg id="2039">But the Oracle was one too many for him, for the answer he got was this: "Stranger, whether the thing that you hold in your hand be alive or dead is a matter that depends entirely on your own will."</seg>
<seg id="2039">可是，圣人远比他更高明，说道：“陌生人，不管你手里的东西是死是活，完全取决于你自己的意愿！”</seg>
<seg id="2040">THE HORSE AND THE ASS</seg>
<seg id="2040">马和驴</seg>
<seg id="2041">A Horse, proud of his fine harness, met an Ass on the high-road.</seg>
<seg id="2041">一匹马对自己精美的马具感到自豪，他在一条小路上遇到了一头满载货物的驴。</seg>
<seg id="2042">As the Ass with his heavy burden moved slowly out of the way to let him pass, the Horse cried out impatiently that he could hardly resist kicking him to make him move faster.</seg>
<seg id="2042">驴因货物太重，只能慢慢地走，而无法让马先过去。马不耐烦地说恨不得踢他一脚，让他快点走。</seg>
<seg id="2043">The Ass held his peace, but did not forget the other's insolence.</seg>
<seg id="2043">驴默不作声，但是没有忘记马的傲慢无礼。</seg>
<seg id="2044">Not long afterwards the Horse became broken-winded, and was sold by his owner to a farmer.</seg>
<seg id="2044">不久，那匹马患了气喘病，被主人卖到了农场。</seg>
<seg id="2045">One day, as he was drawing a dung-cart, he met the Ass again, who in turn derided him and said, "Aha! you never thought to come to this, did you, you who were so proud!</seg>
<seg id="2045">有一天，当马正拉着粪车时，又遇到了驴，驴反而讥笑他说：“哈！你从没想到会来这里干这种活吧，不是吗，你那么傲慢！</seg>
<seg id="2046">Where are all your gay trappings now?"</seg>
<seg id="2046">现在，你那华丽的马具到哪里去了？”</seg>
<seg id="2047">THE DOG CHASING A WOLF</seg>
<seg id="2047">追赶狼的狗</seg>
<seg id="2048">A Dog was chasing a Wolf, and as he ran he thought what a fine fellow he was, and what strong legs he had, and how quickly they covered the ground.</seg>
<seg id="2048">一条狗正在追赶一只狼，他边跑边想，自己是一条多么好的狗呀，腿多么健壮，跑得又是多么的快。</seg>
<seg id="2049">"Now, there's this Wolf," he said to himself, "what a poor creature he is:</seg>
<seg id="2049">狗自言自语道：“现在，看看这只狼，多么可怜呀，</seg>
<seg id="2050">he's no match for me, and he knows it and so he runs away."</seg>
<seg id="2050">他根本不是我的对手，他很有自知之明，所以才会逃跑。”</seg>
<seg id="2051">But the Wolf looked round just then and said, "Don't you imagine I'm running away from you, my friend:</seg>
<seg id="2051">然而，狼却回过头来对他说：“朋友，不要以为我因为惧怕你才逃跑，</seg>
<seg id="2052">it's your master I'm afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="2052">让我害怕的是你身后的主人。”</seg>
<seg id="2053">GRIEF AND HIS DUE</seg>
<seg id="2053">悲伤和他被指派的份额</seg>
<seg id="2054">When Jupiter was assigning the various gods their privileges, it so happened that Grief was not present with the rest:</seg>
<seg id="2054">朱庇特正在给不同的神灵指派特权，恰巧悲伤没有到场。</seg>
<seg id="2055">but when all had received their share, he too entered and claimed his due.</seg>
<seg id="2055">但是，当所有神灵都得到了指派的份额后，悲伤进来了，也声称想要他应得的份额。</seg>
<seg id="2056">Jupiter was at a loss to know what to do, for there was nothing left for him.</seg>
<seg id="2056">朱庇特有点不知所措，因为什么都没有留给他。</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, at last he decided that to him should belong the tears that are shed for the dead.</seg>
<seg id="2057">然而，朱庇特最后决定，悲伤应该属于为亡人而流下的泪水。</seg>
<seg id="2058">Thus it is the same with Grief as it is with the other gods.</seg>
<seg id="2058">因此，悲伤与其他神灵一样，也得到了属于自己的份额。</seg>
<seg id="2059">The more devoutly men render to him his due, the more lavish is he of that which he has to bestow.</seg>
<seg id="2059">越发虔诚地回报给悲伤，悲伤就会越发大方地赋予你属于他的份额。</seg>
<seg id="2060">It is not well, therefore, to mourn long for the departed;</seg>
<seg id="2060">所以，长久地为逝者而悲伤并不好。</seg>
<seg id="2061">else Grief, whose sole pleasure is in such mourning, will be quick to send fresh cause for tears.</seg>
<seg id="2061">悲伤的唯一乐趣就在这样的哀悼中，否则，他会迅速为泪水寻找新的原因。</seg>
<seg id="2062">THE WOMAN AND THE FARMER</seg>
<seg id="2062">女人和农夫</seg>
<seg id="2063">A Woman, who had lately lost her husband, used to go every day to his grave and lament her loss.</seg>
<seg id="2063">有一个女人刚刚失去了丈夫，她每天都要到丈夫的坟上痛哭一场。</seg>
<seg id="2064">A Farmer, who was engaged in ploughing not far from the spot, set eyes upon the Woman and desired to have her for his wife:</seg>
<seg id="2064">有一个农夫在不远处耕地，一直观察着这个女人，想娶她为妻。</seg>
<seg id="2065">so he left his plough and came and sat by her side, and began to shed tears himself.</seg>
<seg id="2065">于是，农夫放下自己的犁，来到她身边坐下，也痛哭起来。</seg>
<seg id="2066">She asked him why he wept; and he replied, "I have lately lost my wife, who was very dear to me, and tears ease my grief."</seg>
<seg id="2066">女人问他为什么哭，农夫回答说：“我的妻子最近也死了，她和我非常恩爱，也许眼泪能够减轻我的悲伤。”</seg>
<seg id="2067">"And I," said she, "have lost my husband."</seg>
<seg id="2067">女人说：“我丈夫也是刚刚去世。”</seg>
<seg id="2068">And so for a while they mourned in silence.</seg>
<seg id="2068">两人就这样默然哀伤了一阵子。</seg>
<seg id="2069">Then he said, "Since you and I are in like case, shall we not do well to marry and live together?</seg>
<seg id="2069">接着，农夫说：“既然你我遭遇相同，我们为何不结为夫妻，在一起生活呢？</seg>
<seg id="2070">I shall take the place of your dead husband, and you, that of my dead wife."</seg>
<seg id="2070">我替代你死去的丈夫，而你则替代我死去的妻子。”</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Woman consented to the plan, which indeed seemed reasonable enough:</seg>
<seg id="2071">这个想法听起来的确很有道理，那女人高兴地同意了。</seg>
<seg id="2072">and they dried their tears.</seg>
<seg id="2072">[无]</seg>
<seg id="2073">Meanwhile, a thief had come and stolen the oxen which the Farmer had left with his plough.</seg>
<seg id="2073">这时候，有一个贼偷走了农夫丢下的公牛。</seg>
<seg id="2074">On discovering the theft, he beat his breast and loudly bewailed his loss.</seg>
<seg id="2074">看到自己的牛被偷了，农夫不禁捶胸顿足地悲叹自己的损失。</seg>
<seg id="2075">When the Woman heard his cries, she came and said, "Why, are you weeping still?"</seg>
<seg id="2075">此刻，女人听见了他的哭声，走过来问道：“为什么，你还在哭吗？”</seg>
<seg id="2076">To which he replied, "Yes, and I mean it this time."</seg>
<seg id="2076">农夫回答：“是的！这一次是真心的。”</seg>
<seg id="2077">PROMETHEUS AND THE MAKING OF MAN</seg>
<seg id="2077">普罗米修斯与造人</seg>
<seg id="2078">At the bidding of Jupiter, Prometheus set about the creation of Man and the other animals.</seg>
<seg id="2078">遵照朱庇特的命令，普罗米修斯创造了人和其他动物。</seg>
<seg id="2079">Jupiter, seeing that Mankind, the only rational creatures, were far outnumbered by the irrational beasts, bade him redress the balance by turning some of the latter into men.</seg>
<seg id="2079">其中，只有人是理性的生灵，朱庇特看到不理性的动物数量远远超过了人，便命令他更改一下比例，把一部分动物变成人。</seg>
<seg id="2080">Prometheus did as he was bidden, and this is the reason why some people have the forms of men but the souls of beasts.</seg>
<seg id="2080">普罗米修斯奉命行事。因此，正是这个原因，有些人虽然有着人的外形，内心却仍与动物一样。</seg>
<seg id="2081">THE SWALLOW AND THE CROW</seg>
<seg id="2081">燕子和乌鸦</seg>
<seg id="2082">A Swallow was once boasting to a Crow about her birth.</seg>
<seg id="2082">有一次，燕子冲着乌鸦吹嘘自己的出生多么显赫。</seg>
<seg id="2083">"I was once a princess," said she, "the daughter of a King of Athens, but my husband used me cruelly, and cut out my tongue for a slight fault.</seg>
<seg id="2083">“我曾经是一个公主，”燕子说，“是雅典国王的女儿，但是我的丈夫却因为我的一个小过失而割掉了我的舌头。</seg>
<seg id="2084">Then, to protect me from further injury, I was turned by Juno into a bird."</seg>
<seg id="2084">为了以免再次受到伤害，朱诺就把我变成了一只鸟。”</seg>
<seg id="2085">"You chatter quite enough as it is," said the Crow.</seg>
<seg id="2085">“你可真会搬弄是非，”乌鸦说，</seg>
<seg id="2086">"What you would have been like if you hadn't lost your tongue, I can't think."</seg>
<seg id="2086">“要是你没有损失舌头，又会变成什么样呢？我简直不敢想象。”</seg>
<seg id="2087">THE HUNTER AND THE HORSEMAN</seg>
<seg id="2087">猎人和骑手</seg>
<seg id="2088">A Hunter went out after game, and succeeded in catching a hare, which he was carrying home with him when he met a man on horseback, who said to him, "You have had some sport I see, sir," and offered to buy it.</seg>
<seg id="2088">有个猎人出外打猎后，扛着一只兔子归来，途中遇见一个骑马的人，那人停下来说：“你已经收获猎物回来了，先生。”而且还假装要买兔子。</seg>
<seg id="2089">The Hunter readily agreed;</seg>
<seg id="2089">猎人很高兴地同意了，</seg>
<seg id="2090">but the Horseman had no sooner got the hare in his hands than he set spurs to his horse and went off at full gallop.</seg>
<seg id="2090">可是骑马人一拿到兔子，立刻就用鞭子抽了马一下，飞奔而去。</seg>
<seg id="2091">The Hunter ran after him for some little distance;</seg>
<seg id="2091">猎人拼命地在后面追赶了一阵子，</seg>
<seg id="2092">but it soon dawned upon him that he had been tricked, and he gave up trying to overtake the Horseman, and, to save his face, called after him as loud as he could, "All right, sir, all right, take your hare:</seg>
<seg id="2092">但是很快就明白自己上当了，不再去追骑马人。为了挽回自己的颜面，猎人在骑马人身后大声喊道：“好吧，好吧，拿走吧！</seg>
<seg id="2093">it was meant all along as a present."</seg>
<seg id="2093">那只兔子送给你了。”</seg>
<seg id="2094">THE GOATHERD AND THE WILD GOATS</seg>
<seg id="2094">牧羊人和野山羊</seg>
<seg id="2095">A Goatherd was tending his goats out at pasture when he saw a number of Wild Goats approach and mingle with his flock.</seg>
<seg id="2095">牧羊人赶着羊群去牧场吃草，他看到几只野山羊混进了羊群里。</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the end of the day he drove them home and put them all into the pen together.</seg>
<seg id="2096">傍晚，他将所有的羊都赶回家，关进了羊圈。</seg>
<seg id="2097">Next day the weather was so bad that he could not take them out as usual:</seg>
<seg id="2097">第二天，天气很不好，无法像往常那样到牧场里去放牧了，</seg>
<seg id="2098">so he kept them at home in the pen, and fed them there.</seg>
<seg id="2098">于是，他只好让羊群待在羊圈里，在那里喂它们吃草。</seg>
<seg id="2099">He only gave his own goats enough food to keep them from starving, but he gave the Wild Goats as much as they could eat and more;</seg>
<seg id="2099">他只给自己的羊一点点刚够果腹的草，却给那些野山羊更多的草吃，</seg>
<seg id="2100">for he was very anxious for them to stay, and he thought that if he fed them well they wouldn't want to leave him.</seg>
<seg id="2100">因为他希望让那些野山羊留下来。他心想，只要给它们多吃点草，野山羊可能就不想离开他了。</seg>
<seg id="2101">When the weather improved, he took them all out to pasture again;</seg>
<seg id="2101">等天气转好，牧羊人又赶着所有的羊来到了牧场。</seg>
<seg id="2102">but no sooner had they got near the hills than the Wild Goats broke away from the flock and scampered off.</seg>
<seg id="2102">刚来到山下，那些野山羊立刻冲出羊群，四散而逃。</seg>
<seg id="2103">The Goatherd was very much disgusted at this, and roundly abused them for their ingratitude.</seg>
<seg id="2103">牧羊人十分生气，指责它们忘恩负义。</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Rascals!" he cried, "to run away like that after the way I've treated you!"</seg>
<seg id="2104">“你们这些混蛋！”他喊道，“我对你们那么好，竟然以这种方式纷纷逃跑了！”</seg>
<seg id="2105">Hearing this, one of them turned round and said, "Oh, yes, you treated us all right--too well, in fact;</seg>
<seg id="2105">野山羊听到他的话，回过头来说：“是的，你对我们很好，</seg>
<seg id="2106">it was just that that put us on our guard. </seg>
<seg id="2106">实际上是太好了，正因如此，我们才会更加小心。</seg>
<seg id="2107">If you treat newcomers like ourselves so much better than your own flock, it's more than likely that, if another lot of strange goats joined yours, we should then be neglected in favour of the last comers."</seg>
<seg id="2107">你对待我们这些新来的羊比你自己的羊群还要好，那么很有可能，当另外一群陌生的羊再加入进来时，我们也会受到冷落，而你却只偏爱它们了。”</seg>
<seg id="2108">THE NIGHTINGALE AND THE SWALLOW</seg>
<seg id="2108">夜莺和燕子</seg>

<seg id="2109">一只燕子在和一只夜莺聊天，燕子劝她不要在茂密的树丛上做窝了，像自己一样与人住在一起。</seg>
<seg id="2110">But the Nightingale replied, "Time was when I too, like yourself, lived among men:</seg>
<seg id="2110">可是，夜莺却回答说：“我过去也曾像你一样和人住在一起，</seg>
<seg id="2111">but the memory of the cruel wrongs I then suffered makes them hateful to me, and never again will I approach their dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="2111">但是我所遭受的那份痛苦回忆让他们都不喜欢我，我永远都不想再接近他们的住所。”</seg>
<seg id="2112">The scene of past sufferings revives painful memories.</seg>
<seg id="2112">痛苦的回忆使得过去的痛苦体验历历在目。</seg>

<seg id="2115">他差一点就掉到井里去，这时，命运女神出现在他面前，并且摸着他的肩膀，提醒他离井远一点。</seg>
<seg id="2116">"Wake up, good sir, I pray you," she said; "had you fallen into the well, the blame would have been thrown not on your own folly but on me, Fortune."</seg>
<seg id="2116">“朋友，拜托你，快醒醒，”女神说，“你若是掉到井里去，一定会责怪我，而不会责怪自己的愚蠢。”</seg>
