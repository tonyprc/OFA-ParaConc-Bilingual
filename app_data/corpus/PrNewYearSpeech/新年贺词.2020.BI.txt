<seg id="32">Everything is flourishing across our motherland.</seg>
<seg id="33">我沿着中国革命的征程砥砺初心。</seg>
<seg id="33">I traced the routes of China’s revolution to remain true to my original mission.</seg>
<seg id="34">从江西于都红军长征集结出发地到河南新县鄂豫皖苏区首府革命博物馆，从甘肃高台西路军纪念碑到北京香山革命纪念地，每个地方都让我思绪万千，初心和使命是我们走好新时代长征路的不竭动力。</seg>
<seg id="34">From Yudu in Jiangxi Province where the Red Army gathered for their Long March, to the Revolution Museum in Xinxian County in Henan Province, the former capital of the Hubei-Henan-Anhui revolutionary base, from the Monument to the West Route Army in Gaotai, Gansu Province, to the revolutionary memorial site in the Fragrant Hills in Beijing, all these places aroused many feelings and thoughts in my mind. Our original aspiration and mission are our inexhaustible source of motivation during our Long March of the new era.</seg>
<seg id="35">同往常一样，我无论多忙，都要抽时间到乡亲们中走一走看一看。</seg>
<seg id="35">As usual, no matter how busy I was, I spent time visiting people in the countryside.</seg>

<seg id="39">一年来，许多人和事感动着我们。</seg>
<seg id="39">Over the past year, many people and their stories touched us deeply.</seg>
<seg id="40">一辈子深藏功名、初心不改的张富清，把青春和生命献给脱贫事业的黄文秀，为救火而捐躯的四川木里31名勇士，用自己身体保护战友的杜富国，以十一连胜夺取世界杯冠军的中国女排......</seg>

The greater the difficulties, the further we advance, strengthening our weak links even more and laying a more solid foundation to win the hard battle with determination against poverty, to lift all impoverished rural residents and counties out of poverty by current standards as scheduled.</seg>
