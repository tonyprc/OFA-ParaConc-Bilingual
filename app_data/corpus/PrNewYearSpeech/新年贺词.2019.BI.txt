<seg id="4">同志们，朋友们，女士们，先生们：</seg>
<seg id="4">Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen,</seg>
<seg id="5">大家好！</seg>
<seg id="5">Greetings to you all!</seg>
<seg id="6">“岁月不居，时节如流。”</seg>
<seg id="6">"Time stops for no one, and the seasons keep changing."</seg>
<seg id="7">2019年马上就要到了，我在北京向大家致以新年的美好祝福！</seg>
<seg id="7">As we usher in 2019, I'd like to extend my New Year wishes from Beijing to you all!</seg>
<seg id="8">2018年，我们过得很充实、走得很坚定。</seg>
<seg id="8">2018 has been a full year, and we approached it with steadfast determination.</seg>
<seg id="9">这一年，我们战胜各种风险挑战，推动经济高质量发展，加快新旧动能转换，保持经济运行在合理区间。</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite all sorts of risks and challenges, we pushed our economy towards high-quality development, sped up the replacement of the old drivers of growth, and kept the major economic indicators within a reasonable range.</seg>
<seg id="10">蓝天、碧水、净土保卫战顺利推进，各项民生事业加快发展，人民生活持续改善。</seg>
<seg id="10">We made headway in our efforts to protect our blue skies, and to defend our rivers and soil from pollution.  And we intensified our efforts to improve people's well-being and steadily raise our standards of living.</seg>
<seg id="11">京津冀协同发展、长江经济带发展、粤港澳大湾区建设等国家战略稳步实施。</seg>
<seg id="11">National strategies such as the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, and the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area were steadfastly implemented.</seg>
<seg id="12">我在各地考察时欣喜地看到：长江两岸绿意盎然，建三江万亩大地号稻浪滚滚，深圳前海生机勃勃，上海张江活力四射，港珠澳大桥飞架三地……</seg>
<seg id="12">During my inspection tours around the country, I was pleased to see the lush green banks of the Yangtze River, the ocean of rice sprouting at the Jiansanjiang agricultural base, the lively Shenzhen Qianhai Harbor, the bustling Shanghai Zhangjiang High-tech Park, and the bridge that brings together Hong Kong, Zhuhai, and Macao.</seg>
<seg id="13">这些成就是全国各族人民撸起袖子干出来的，是新时代奋斗者挥洒汗水拼出来的。</seg>
<seg id="13">These achievements are all thanks to the hard work of people from all of China's ethnic groups, who are the trail-blazers of the new era.</seg>
<seg id="14">这一年，中国制造、中国创造、中国建造共同发力，继续改变着中国的面貌。</seg>
<seg id="14">Over the past year, the combined forces of Chinese manufacturing, Chinese innovation, and Chinese construction, have continued to change the face of the country.</seg>
<seg id="15">嫦娥四号探测器成功发射，第二艘航母出海试航，国产大型水陆两栖飞机水上首飞，北斗导航向全球组网迈出坚实一步。</seg>
<seg id="15">We successfully launched the Chang'e-4 lunar probe; our second aircraft carrier set sail on its maiden voyage; our domestically-made large amphibious aircraft performed its first water launch; and the BeiDou Satellite Navigation System has gone global.</seg>
<seg id="16">在此，我要向每一位科学家、每一位工程师、每一位“大国工匠”、每一位建设者和参与者致敬！</seg>
<seg id="16">Let me take this opportunity to salute every scientist, every engineer, and every nation builder who made these achievements possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">这一年，脱贫攻坚传来很多好消息。</seg>
<seg id="17">We have also made great strides in our poverty alleviation efforts in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="18">全国又有125个贫困县通过验收脱贫，1000万农村贫困人口摆脱贫困。</seg>
<seg id="18">Another 125 poor counties and 10 million poverty-stricken rural residents were lifted out of poverty.</seg>
<seg id="19">17种抗癌药降价并纳入医保目录，因病致贫问题正在进一步得到解决。</seg>
<seg id="19">We reduced the price of 17 cancer-fighting drugs, and included them on our medical insurance list. And we are continuing to tackle the financial strain that can accompany a family member falling ill.</seg>
<seg id="20">我时常牵挂着奋战在脱贫一线的同志们，280多万驻村干部、第一书记，工作很投入、很给力，一定要保重身体。</seg>
<seg id="20">Our comrades on the front lines of the fight against poverty are often in my thoughts, including over 2.8 million officials living and working in villages, and the local village leaders. They are devoted to their work and do an awesome job, and I wish them good health.</seg>
<seg id="21">我始终惦记着困难群众。</seg>
<seg id="21">My heart goes out to the people living in hardship.</seg>
<seg id="22">在四川凉山三河村，我看望了彝族村民吉好也求、节列俄阿木两家人。</seg>
<seg id="22">In Sanhe Village of Liangshan in Sichuan Province, I visited the families of two villagers from the Yi people.</seg>
<seg id="23">在山东济南三涧溪村，我和赵顺利一家围坐一起拉家常。</seg>
<seg id="23">In Sanjianxi Village in Jinan City in Shandong Province, I sat down with the family of Zhao Shunli to hear about their day-to-day lives.</seg>
<seg id="24">在辽宁抚顺东华园社区，我到陈玉芳家里了解避险搬迁安置情况。</seg>
<seg id="24">In the Donghuayuan community in the city of Fushun in Liaoning Province, I visited Chen Yufang's family to learn about how they were settling in after being relocated from a dangerous area.</seg>
<seg id="25">在广东清远连樟村，我和贫困户陆奕和交谈脱贫之计。</seg>
<seg id="25">In Lianzhang Village in Qingyuan in Guangdong Province, I discussed with a villager named Lu Yihe how we could help to relieve his household's poverty.</seg>
<seg id="26">他们真诚朴实的面容至今浮现在我的脑海。</seg>
<seg id="26">I can vividly recall their down-to-earth sincerity.</seg>
<seg id="27">新年之际，祝乡亲们的生活蒸蒸日上，越过越红火。</seg>
<seg id="27">I would like to wish all of them and their fellow villagers a prosperous and thriving New Year.</seg>
<seg id="28">这一年，我们隆重庆祝改革开放40周年，对党和国家机构进行了系统性、整体性、重构性的改革，推出100多项重要改革举措，举办首届中国国际进口博览会，启动建设海南自由贸易试验区。</seg>
<seg id="28">In 2018, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up. We unveiled a comprehensive and systematic overhaul of both Party and State institutions. We launched over 100 major reform measures, held the first China International Import Expo, and began construction of a pilot free trade zone in Hainan.</seg>
<seg id="29">世界看到了改革开放的中国加速度，看到了将改革开放进行到底的中国决心。</seg>
<seg id="29">The world has seen China's accelerating reform and opening up, and its determination to carry it forward.</seg>
<seg id="30">我们改革的脚步不会停滞，开放的大门只会越开越大。</seg>
<seg id="30">China's reforms will never stop, and its doors will only open ever wider.</seg>
<seg id="31">我注意到，今年，恢复高考后的第一批大学生大多已经退休，大批“00后”进入高校校园。</seg>
<seg id="31">I noticed that in the past year, most people who enrolled in college when the entrance exam resumed in 1977 have retired. And a large number of people born after 2000 have entered university.</seg>
<seg id="32">1亿多非户籍人口在城市落户的行动正在继续，1300万人在城镇找到了工作，解决棚户区问题的住房开工了580万套，新市民有了温暖的家。</seg>
<seg id="32">More than 100 million people from our rural areas are gradually becoming permanent residents in our cities.  13 million have found jobs, and construction has begun on 5.8 million new homes for those people living in dilapidated houses. Many have already moved into their new warm homes.</seg>
<seg id="33">很多港澳台居民拿到了居住证，香港进入了全国高铁网。</seg>
<seg id="33">Many people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan now have resident permits for the mainland, and Hong Kong has become a stop on our high-speed railway network.</seg>
<seg id="34">一个流动的中国，充满了繁荣发展的活力。</seg>
<seg id="34">China, as a country of people on the move, is energetically pursuing prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="35">我们都在努力奔跑，我们都是追梦人。</seg>
<seg id="35">We are running at full speed towards the realization of our dreams.</seg>
<seg id="36">此时此刻，我特别要提到一些闪亮的名字。</seg>
<seg id="36">At this point, I'd like to mention several leading lights.</seg>
<seg id="37">今年，天上多了颗“南仁东星”，全军英模挂像里多了林俊德和张超两位同志。</seg>
<seg id="37">Nan Rendong, a Chinese scientist after whom an asteroid was named a few months ago; Lin Junde and Zhang Chao, who joined the long list of exemplary soldiers in the People's Liberation Army;</seg>
<seg id="38">我们要记住守岛卫国32年的王继才同志，为保护试验平台挺身而出、壮烈牺牲的黄群、宋月才、姜开斌同志，以及其他为国为民捐躯的英雄们。</seg>
<seg id="38">Wang Jicai, who for thirty-two years served on a border island; and those who died protecting an experimental offshore platform - Huang Qun, Song Yuecai, and Jiang Kaibin, and the many other heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country.</seg>
<seg id="39">他们是新时代最可爱的人，永远值得我们怀念和学习。</seg>
<seg id="39">They are the most admirable people in China's new era, and we should remember their names forever, and learn from their deeds.</seg>
<seg id="40">这一年，又有很多新老朋友来到中国。</seg>
<seg id="40">In 2018, China played host to many friends, both old and new.</seg>

<seg id="42">I and my colleagues visited five continents and attended many important diplomatic events. We spoke with state leaders about wide-ranging issues, we strengthened our friendships, we enhanced mutual trust, and we enlarged our circle of friends.</seg>
<seg id="43">2019年，我们将隆重庆祝中华人民共和国70周年华诞。</seg>
<seg id="43">In 2019, we will celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.</seg>
<seg id="44">70年披荆斩棘，70年风雨兼程。</seg>
<seg id="44">Our country has braved thorny paths and confronted stormy weather over the past seventy years.</seg>
<seg id="45">人民是共和国的坚实根基，人民是我们执政的最大底气。</seg>
<seg id="45">Our people are the country's solid foundation and our main source of confidence to govern.</seg>
<seg id="46">一路走来，中国人民自力更生、艰苦奋斗，创造了举世瞩目的中国奇迹。</seg>
<seg id="46">Through the years, the Chinese people have been self-reliant and worked diligently to create Chinese miracles that the world has marveled at.</seg>
<seg id="47">新征程上，不管乱云飞渡、风吹浪打，我们都要紧紧依靠人民，坚持自力更生、艰苦奋斗，以坚如磐石的信心、只争朝夕的劲头、坚韧不拔的毅力，一步一个脚印把前无古人的伟大事业推向前进。</seg>
<seg id="47">And now, looking forward, despite the complexities and difficulties we may face on the road ahead, we shall always closely rely on the people and stick to self-reliance and hard work. With rock-solid confidence, and racing against time with unwavering determination, we will carry forward our unprecedented great cause one resolute step after another, and leave enduring footprints behind us.</seg>
<seg id="48">2019年，有机遇也有挑战，大家还要一起拼搏、一起奋斗。</seg>
<seg id="48">2019 will see both opportunities and challenges that will require us to work together shoulder to shoulder.</seg>
<seg id="49">减税降费政策措施要落地生根，让企业轻装上阵。</seg>

<seg id="51">We must lend an ear to our officials at the grassroots, and bring energy and greater purpose to those who are ready to commit to making a difference.</seg>

<seg id="54">Even as we speak, there are deliverymen, street cleaners, taxi drivers, and countless others who are hard at work. We should thank these workers who contribute to the creation of our beautiful society.</seg>
<seg id="55">大家辛苦了。</seg>
<seg id="55">Their hard work is much appreciated.</seg>
<seg id="56">放眼全球，我们正面临百年未有之大变局。</seg>
<seg id="56">Looking at the world at large, we're facing a period of major change never seen in a century.</seg>
<seg id="57">无论国际风云如何变幻，中国维护国家主权和安全的信心和决心不会变，中国维护世界和平、促进共同发展的诚意和善意不会变。</seg>
<seg id="57">No matter what these changes bring, China will remain resolute and confident in its defense of its national sovereignty and security. And China's sincerity and goodwill to safeguard world peace and promote common development will remain unchanged.</seg>
