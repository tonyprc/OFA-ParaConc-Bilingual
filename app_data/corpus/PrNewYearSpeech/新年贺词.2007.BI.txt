<seg id="5">女士们，先生们，同志们，朋友们：</seg>
<seg id="5">Ladies and Gentlemen, Comrades and Friends,</seg>
<seg id="6">新年的钟声即将敲响。</seg>
<seg id="6">The bell sounding the New Year 2007 is ringing.</seg>
<seg id="7">在这世界各国人民共迎2007年到来的美好时刻，我很高兴通过中国国际广播电台、中央人民广播电台和中央电视台，向全国各族人民，向香港特别行政区同胞和澳门特别行政区同胞，向台湾同胞和海外侨胞，向世界各国的朋友们，致以新年的祝福！</seg>
<seg id="7">At this key moment poised between the new year and the old for people of all countries, I'm very happy to extend New Year greetings to all Chinese people - including our compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, all the overseas Chinese, and our friends around the world - in this message broadcast on China Radio International, China National Radio and China Central Television.</seg>
<seg id="8">2006年，是中国实施“十一五”规划的开局之年。</seg>
<seg id="8">2006 was the first year of China's eleventh Five-year Plan.</seg>
<seg id="9">中国各族人民团结一心、奋发努力，全面推进社会主义经济建设、政治建设、文化建设、社会建设，国民经济和社会发展取得新成就，人民生活水平进一步提高。</seg>
<seg id="9">During the year, Chinese people of all ethnic groups united with one heart and one mind worked hard to push forward socialist economic construction, political construction, cultural construction and social construction. China made new achievements in national economic and social development and the Chinese people's living standards were further improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">中国又向全面建设小康社会的目标迈出了坚实一步。</seg>
<seg id="10">China has taken another solid step towards the goal of building a well-off society in an all-round way.</seg>
<seg id="11">与此同时，我们全方位开展对外交流合作，广泛参与国际双边和多边事务，积极推动国际热点难点问题解决进程，为维护世界和平、促进共同发展作出了贡献。</seg>
<seg id="11">At the same time, China has conducted all-directional exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries and widely participated in bilateral and multilateral affairs of the world. China has actively given impetus to processes resolving hot and difficult international issues, and contributed to safeguarding world peace and promoting common development.</seg>
<seg id="12">前不久，中国共产党召开十六届六中全会，就构建社会主义和谐社会作出了全面部署。</seg>
<seg id="12">At the recent Sixth Plenum of the 16th CPC Central Committee, a basic plan for building a harmonious socialist society was drafted.</seg>
<seg id="13">中国各族人民正以勤劳和智慧创造着自己的幸福生活和美好未来。</seg>
<seg id="13">Chinese people of all ethnic groups are creating a happier life and brighter future through their industrious work and wisdom.</seg>
<seg id="14">2007年，是中国人民全面落实科学发展观、加快构建社会主义和谐社会的重要一年。</seg>
<seg id="14">2007 is an important year for the Chinese people to fully implement the scientific outlook on development and accelerate the pace of building a harmonious socialist society.</seg>
<seg id="15">我们将按照经济社会又好又快发展的要求，着力调整经济结构和转变增长方式，着力加强资源节约和环境保护，着力推进改革开放和自主创新，着力促进社会发展和解决民生问题，推动经济社会发展切实转入科学发展的轨道。</seg>
<seg id="15">Bearing the need for efficient social and economic development in mind, we will focus on adjusting the economic structure and change our mode of growth. We will also work harder to save energy and protect the environment, while strengthening reform and promoting innovation. We will painstakingly boost social development and care for people's well-being, while pushing economic and social development into the orbit of scientific development.</seg>
<seg id="16">我们将坚持“一国两制”、“港人治港”、“澳人治澳”、高度自治的方针，支持香港、澳门特别行政区政府和行政长官依法施政，扩大内地同香港、澳门的交流合作，共同维护香港、澳门长期繁荣稳定。</seg>
<seg id="16">We will adhere to the policies of “one country, two systems,” “Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong” and “Macao people governing Macao” with a high degree of autonomy. We will support the governments of the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions and their chief executives to rule according to law. We will also expand the mainland's communication and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao, in a joint effort to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of both regions.</seg>
<seg id="17">我们将坚持“和平统一、一国两制”的基本方针，围绕两岸关系和平发展的主题，加强两岸人员往来和经济文化交流合作，维护台海和平稳定，推进中国和平统一大业。</seg>
<seg id="17">We will also adhere to the basic principle of "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems".  We will enhance cross-Straits personnel exchange, and economic and cultural cooperation, in the context of peaceful development, to ensure peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits and push forward the peaceful reunification of China.</seg>
<seg id="18">当前，国际形势继续发生深刻而复杂的变化。世界多极化继续演进，世界经济保持增长，各国相互依存和合作日益加深，维护世界和平、促进共同发展面临着新的机遇。</seg>
<seg id="18">At present, the international situation is undergoing profound and complicated changes, with deepening multi-polarization, steady economic growth, increasing interdependency, greater cooperation and new opportunities to safeguard world peace and promote common development.</seg>
<seg id="19">同时，局部战争和冲突时起时伏，南北差距进一步拉大，恐怖主义、跨国犯罪、环境污染、自然灾害、严重传染性疾病等全球性问题突出，维护世界和平、促进共同发展也面临着新的挑战。</seg>
<seg id="19">At the same time, sporadic regional wars and conflicts, the widening gap between developed and developing countries and the growing prominence of global issues - like terrorism, transnational crime, environmental protection, natural disasters and highly communicable diseases - pose new challenges to world peace and common development.</seg>
<seg id="20">面对机遇和挑战并存的国际形势，中国人民真诚希望同世界各国人民互利合作、和谐相处，共同奏响和平、发展、合作的时代主旋律。</seg>
<seg id="20">Against this backdrop of coexisting opportunities and challenges, Chinese people sincerely hope to carry out mutually beneficial cooperation and live in harmony with people across the world to jointly promote peace, development and cooperation as the major theme of our time.</seg>
<seg id="21">借此机会，我愿重申，中国外交政策的宗旨是维护世界和平、促进共同发展。</seg>
<seg id="21">I would like to avail myself of this occasion to reiterate that China's diplomatic efforts are based on safeguarding world peace and promoting common development.</seg>
<seg id="22">中国人民将坚定不移地走和平发展道路，坚定不移地实施互利共赢的开放战略，同世界各国加强经济文化交流合作，共同推进多边主义和国际关系民主化，维护世界多样性和发展模式多样化，促进经济全球化朝着有利于实现共同繁荣的方向发展，为推动建设持久和平、共同繁荣的和谐世界贡献力量。</seg>
<seg id="22">The Chinese people will unswervingly pursue peaceful development and a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy. We will enhance economic and cultural cooperation with other countries to jointly promote multilateralism, and the democratization of international relations. We will also work to safeguard the diversity of the world and its development models, and make sure that economic globalization will move in a direction that is conducive to building a harmonious world based on long-term peace and common prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="23">当今世界，不少国家和地区的民众仍在忍受着战火、贫困、疾病等磨难。</seg>
<seg id="23">In the present-day world, people in many countries and regions around the world are still suffering from the scourge of wars, poverty and disease.</seg>
<seg id="24">中国人民对他们怀着深切同情，愿意为他们提供力所能及的帮助。</seg>
<seg id="24">The Chinese people are deeply sympathetic to their plight and willing to extend all the assistance our country can summon.</seg>
<seg id="25">我们衷心祝愿一切处于磨难中的人民早日走出困境，衷心祝愿世界各国人民共享和平与发展的成果。</seg>
<seg id="25">We sincerely wish all their miseries will end as soon as possible, so the people of the world can enjoy the fruits of peace and development together.</seg>
