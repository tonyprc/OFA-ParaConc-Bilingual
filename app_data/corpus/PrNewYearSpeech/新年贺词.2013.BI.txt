<seg id="10">中国继续开展全方位外交，加强同各国的交流合作，积极参与解决国际和地区热点问题，为世界和平与发展作出了新的贡献。</seg>
<seg id="10">China has continued to pursue an all-directional foreign policy and strengthened exchanges and cooperation with various countries. China has taken an active part in resolving global problems and regional hot-spot issues and made contributions to world peace and development.</seg>
<seg id="11">2012年，是中国发展进程中具有重大而深远意义的一年。</seg>
<seg id="11">The year 2012 has been an important and significant year for China's development.</seg>
<seg id="12">前不久召开的中国共产党第十八次全国代表大会和十八届一中全会，描绘了全面建成小康社会和深化改革开放的宏伟蓝图，顺利实现了中国共产党中央领导机构新老交替。</seg>
<seg id="12">The recent 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the First Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee have drawn a blueprint for building a prosperous society in all respects and achieved a smooth power transition for the CPC central leadership.</seg>
<seg id="13">当前，中国各族人民正紧密团结在以习近平同志为总书记的党中央周围，万众一心，锐意进取，为全面建成小康社会而奋斗。</seg>
<seg id="13">At present, Chinese people of all ethnic groups are closely united around the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as general secretary, and are forging courageously ahead in building a well-off society in an all-round way.</seg>
<seg id="14">2013年，中国政府和人民将高举中国特色社会主义伟大旗帜，坚持以科学发展为主题、以转变经济发展方式为主线，继续把握好稳中求进的工作总基调，全面推进改革开放和社会主义现代化建设，为实现党的十八大确定的目标任务开好局、起好步。</seg>
<seg id="14">In the year 2013, the Chinese government and people will continue to hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics, adhere to the scientific approach to development as the underlying guideline, take the change of the economic growth model as a major task, grasp the fundamental key of seeking progress amidst stability, and fully advance the process of reform and opening-up and socialist modernization. This will mark a good beginning for realizing the goals and tasks laid down at the 18th CPC National Congress.</seg>
<seg id="15">我们将坚定不移贯彻“一国两制”、“港人治港”、“澳人治澳”、高度自治方针，深化交流合作，促进香港、澳门长期繁荣稳定。</seg>
<seg id="15">We will uphold the policy of "one country, two systems"--"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and "Macao people governing Macao" with a high degree of autonomy. We will deepen exchanges and cooperation with our compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao to promote long-term prosperity and stability there.</seg>
<seg id="16">我们将继续推动两岸关系和平发展，造福两岸同胞，维护中华民族根本利益。</seg>
<seg id="16">We will continue to advance the peaceful development of relations across the Taiwan Strait, bring well-being to compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and help safeguard the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation.</seg>
<seg id="17">当前，国际形势继续发生深刻复杂变化。</seg>
<seg id="17">At present, the international situation is undergoing significant and complicated changes.</seg>
<seg id="18">和平、发展、合作、共赢是各国人民的共同愿望，各国相互依存日益紧密。</seg>
<seg id="18">Peaceful development and cooperation are the common wishes of people in various countries. Countries depend on each other increasingly closely.</seg>
<seg id="19">同时，国际金融危机影响深远，世界经济低速增长态势仍将延续，一些国家和地区动荡不安，世界仍然很不安宁。</seg>
<seg id="19">At the same time, the international financial crisis has had a far-reaching impact. The slow pace of growth for the international economy will continue. Certain countries and regions are in the throes of upheaval, and the world is still far from being calm.</seg>
<seg id="20">人类只有一个地球，各国共处一个世界。</seg>
<seg id="20">There is only one earth for the human race, and countries coexist in one world.</seg>
<seg id="21">世界和平与发展需要各国人民同舟共济、共同推进。</seg>
<seg id="21">World peace and development requires getting united like passengers in the same boat to push forward together.</seg>
<seg id="22">中国人民始终是促进世界和平与发展的坚定力量。无论国际风云如何变幻，中国人民走和平发展道路的坚定决心决不会动摇。</seg>
<seg id="22">The Chinese people have always been a steadfast force for advancing world peace and development despite international vicissitudes, and will remain unshaken in their firm resolve to take a road of peace and development.</seg>
<seg id="23">中国将一如既往在和平共处五项原则的基础上积极发展同各国的友好合作，积极推动采用和平方式妥善解决国际和地区热点问题，努力促进世界经济强劲、可持续、平衡增长，发挥负责任大国作用。</seg>
<seg id="23">China will, as always, develop friendship and cooperation with various countries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful coexistence, actively promote the proper resolution of international and regional hot-spot issues through peaceful means and the robust sustainable growth for the world economy, and play the role of a responsible big nation.</seg>
<seg id="24">我相信，只要遵循各国人民意愿，顺应世界发展潮流，大家共同努力，就一定能把世界和平与发展的崇高事业不断推向前进，就一定能把各国人民福祉不断提高到新的水平。</seg>
<seg id="24">I believe that so long as we follow the wishes of people of various countries, and conform to the world development trend, we will surely be able to persistently advance the lofty cause of world peace and development, and help raise the well-being of people of various countries to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="25">最后，我从北京祝大家在新的一年里幸福安康！</seg>
