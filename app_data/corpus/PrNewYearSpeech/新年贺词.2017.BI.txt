<seg id="4">Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen,</seg>
<seg id="5">2016年即将过去，新年的钟声即将敲响。</seg>
<seg id="5">The year of 2016 is coming to an end, and the bell of the New Year is going to ring.</seg>
<seg id="6">在这辞旧迎新的美好时刻，我向全国各族人民，向香港特别行政区同胞、澳门特别行政区同胞，向台湾同胞和海外侨胞，向世界各国各地区的朋友们，致以新年的祝福！</seg>

<seg id="7">2016年，对中国人民来说，是非凡的一年，也是难忘的一年，“十三五”实现了开门红。</seg>
<seg id="7">For the Chinese people, the year of 2016 is not only outstanding but also unforgettable. We made a good start of the 13th 5-year National Development Period which spans from 2016 to 2020.</seg>
<seg id="8">我们积极践行新发展理念，加快全面建成小康社会进程，推动我国经济增长继续走在世界前列。</seg>
<seg id="8">We actively carried out the new development concept, accelerated the process of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, and maintained our economic growth ranking the first in the world.</seg>
<seg id="9">我们积极推进全面深化改革，供给侧结构性改革迈出重要步伐，国防和军队改革取得重大突破，各领域具有四梁八柱性质的改革主体框架已经基本确立。</seg>
<seg id="9">We vigorously pushed forward the comprehensive deepening of reform, made important steps in terms of supply-side structural reform, achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the reform of national defense and the military, and the main frame of reform in all fields with "multiple pillars" has been established.</seg>
<seg id="10">我们积极推进全面依法治国，深化司法体制改革，全力促进司法公正、维护社会公平正义。</seg>
<seg id="10">We actively promoted the building of a law-based governance of the country, deepened the reform on the judicial system, enhanced judicial justice in an all-round way, and maintained social fairness and justice.</seg>
<seg id="11">我们积极推进全面从严治党，坚定不移“打虎拍蝇”，继续纯净政治生态，党风、政风、社会风气继续好转。</seg>
<seg id="11">We vigorously pushed forward the exercise of our Party's strict governance in every respect, unswervingly cracked down on both "tigers" and "flies", in a bid to purify our political ecosystem, and continue to improve our Party and our government's working style, as well as our social conduct.</seg>
<seg id="12">2016年，“中国天眼”落成启用，“悟空”号已在轨运行一年，“墨子号”飞向太空，神舟十一号和天宫二号遨游星汉，中国奥运健儿勇创佳绩，中国女排时隔12年再次登上奥运会最高领奖台……</seg>

<seg id="13">还有，通过改革，农村转移人口市民化更便利了，许多贫困地区孩子们上学条件改善了，老百姓异地办理身份证不用来回奔波了，一些长期无户口的人可以登记户口了，很多群众有了自己的家庭医生，每条河流要有“河长”了……</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, our reform measures have made it a little easier for rural migrant workers to settle down in urban areas, and the condition for many children from impoverished areas to receive education has also improved, people don't need to shuttle back and forth between different places when they apply for an identity card in non-native places, some people without permanent household residence for a long time can finally get access to social welfare, many people even have got their own family doctors, and "river chiefs" will be appointed across China for better protection of water resources against pollution in the country.</seg>
<seg id="14">这一切，让我们感到欣慰。</seg>
<seg id="14">All those efforts make us feel a sense of achievement.</seg>
<seg id="15">2016年，在美丽的西子湖畔，我们举办了二十国集团领导人第十一次峰会，向世界贡献了中国智慧、中国方案，也向世界展示了美轮美奂的中国印象、中国风采。</seg>

<seg id="17">We have adhered to the peaceful development while resolutely safeguarding the territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests of China.</seg>
<seg id="18">谁要在这个问题上做文章，中国人民决不答应！</seg>
<seg id="18">We will never tolerate any act that undermines our territorial sovereignty and maritime rights.</seg>
<seg id="19">这一年，多地发生的自然灾害和安全事故，给人民生命财产和生产生活造成严重损失，我们深感痛惜。</seg>
<seg id="19">In the year of 2016, natural disasters and industrial accidents took place in many places across China, bringing severe losses on people's life and property, as well as production. We deeply regret those mishaps.</seg>
<seg id="20">中国维和部队的几名同志壮烈牺牲，为世界和平献出了宝贵生命，我们怀念他们，要把他们的亲人照顾好。</seg>
<seg id="20">On the international front, a few comrades from China's peacekeeping troops have sacrificed their lives while serving their duty to safeguard world peace, we mourn the loss of these soldiers and will repay high tribute to them by taking a good care of their loved ones.</seg>

We will always cherish the memory of the forefathers who have made great contributions to the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. We will remain committed to our mission, and continue to forge ahead.</seg>
<seg id="22">“新故相推，日生不滞。”</seg>
<seg id="22">An ancient saying goes, "the world moves on in a never-ending process of the new replacing the old."</seg>
<seg id="23">即将到来的2017年，中国共产党将召开第十九次全国代表大会，全面建成小康社会、全面深化改革、全面依法治国、全面从严治党要继续发力。</seg>
<seg id="23">In the upcoming year of 2017, the Communist Party of China will convene its 19th national congress, an occasion to renew our commitment to the comprehensive building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, to the comprehensive deepening of reforms, to the comprehensive advancement of rule of law, and to the comprehensive exercising of self-governance of the party.</seg>
<seg id="24">天上不会掉馅饼，努力奋斗才能梦想成真。</seg>
<seg id="24">There is no such thing as a free lunch, and only hard work will make dreams come true.</seg>
<seg id="25">小康路上一个都不能掉队！</seg>
<seg id="25">We will make sure that no one is left behind on our way to prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="26">一年来，又有1000多万贫困人口实现了脱贫，奋战在脱贫攻坚一线的同志们辛苦了，我向同志们致敬。</seg>
<seg id="26">Over the past year, 10 million more people across the country have been lifted out of poverty. I would like to pay high tribute and express appreciation to the comrades who have worked tremendously in grass root unites in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="27">新年之际，我最牵挂的还是困难群众，他们吃得怎么样、住得怎么样，能不能过好新年、过好春节。</seg>
<seg id="27">As we greet the New Year, there is one thing that remains most dearly attached to my heart. That is those fellow citizens who still live in hardship.  I'm seriously concerned and wonder how their food supply and accommodation are being maintained, how they are celebrating the New Year and the Spring Festival.</seg>
<seg id="28">我也了解，部分群众在就业、子女教育、就医、住房等方面还面临一些困难，不断解决好这些问题是党和政府义不容辞的责任。</seg>
<seg id="28">I'm aware that some folks are faced with difficulties in employment, children's education, medical care and housing. To ceaselessly solve those problems remain an unshirkable responsibility for the party and the government.</seg>
<seg id="29">全党全社会要继续关心和帮助贫困人口和有困难的群众，让改革发展成果惠及更多群众，让人民生活更加幸福美满。</seg>
<seg id="29">The whole party and the whole society should show continued care and offer help to those fellow citizens living in poverty. We will enable more people to enjoy the fruit of our reforms, and ultimately let all the people in this country live in happiness.</seg>
<seg id="30">上下同欲者胜。</seg>
<seg id="30">As one saying goes, "success comes to those who share in one purpose".</seg>
<seg id="31">只要我们13亿多人民和衷共济，只要我们党永远同人民站在一起，大家撸起袖子加油干，我们就一定能够走好我们这一代人的长征路。</seg>
<seg id="31">As long as our 1.3 billion-plus people are pulled together for a common cause, as long as the Party stands together with the people and we roll up our sleeves to work harder, we will surely succeed in a Long March of our generation.</seg>
<seg id="32">中国人历来主张“世界大同，天下一家”。</seg>
<seg id="32">The Chinese people have always believed that the world is a commonwealth.</seg>
<seg id="33">中国人民不仅希望自己过得好，也希望各国人民过得好。</seg>
<seg id="33">We Chinese not only aspire for good living for ourselves, but also hope people in other parts of the world lead a decent life.</seg>
<seg id="34">当前，战乱和贫困依然困扰着部分国家和地区，疾病和灾害也时时侵袭着众多的人们。</seg>
<seg id="34">At present, people in certain countries and regions are still troubled in wars and turbulence;  many are suffering from diseases and disasters.</seg>
<seg id="35">我真诚希望，国际社会携起手来，秉持人类命运共同体的理念，把我们这个星球建设得更加和平、更加繁荣。</seg>
<seg id="35">We sincerely hope the international community will make concerted effort, work in the belief that mankind shares the same fate as a community, and build our planet into a more peaceful and prosperous place to live in.</seg>
<seg id="36">让我们满怀信心和期待，一起迎接新年的钟声！</seg>
<seg id="36">May the chime of the New Year consolidate our confidence and re-ignite our aspiration for an even better tomorrow!</seg>
