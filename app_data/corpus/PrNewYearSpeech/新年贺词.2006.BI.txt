<seg id="24">China will continue to stick to the basic state policy of opening to the outside world, continually optimize our investment environment, further open up our market and conduct extensive international cooperation. We'll do our utmost in support of other developing nations to realize rapid development and achieve mutually beneficial and win-win results.</seg>
<seg id="25">当今世界，一些国家的民众依然遭受着战火、贫困、疾病、自然灾害等的煎熬，中国人民对他们始终怀着深切的同情，愿意为他们提供力所能及的帮助，衷心祝愿他们能够早日生活在和平与发展的阳光之下。</seg>
<seg id="25">In today's world, there are still countries suffering from warfare, conflict, hunger and poverty. The Chinese people have deep sympathy towards people in those countries and are willing to offer as much assistance as within our power. We sincerely hope that they would be able to live in the sunshine of peace and development as early as possible.</seg>
